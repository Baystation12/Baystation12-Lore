#Welcome to the Milky Way, Circa 2560
___

The year is 2560 CE (Common Era), and with the help of massive arc ships, humanity has slowly spread out amongst the stars, and colonized our neighboring systems. *Warpgates* now connect Sol and the Colonies, making travel take mere months, rather than decades. The discovery of the seemingly supernatural material, *Phoron*, has also helped push the bounds of science, and with the usage of *Terraforming Machines* also available, on-ship FTL(Faster than Light) drives have become a reality. Colonization and expansion have never been like this before. 
But, more importantly; we are not alone, as we once thought. Other species- The Skrell, Unathi, Tajara, Dionaea, and Resomi, explore the stars alongside us. Expanding the frontier even further- For Knowledge. For Profit.
However, danger lurks just around the corner. Hostile aliens like the Vox, the mysterious and almost virtually unknown Kharmaani Ascent and other, unknown species who we have yet to discover. Various *subversive organizations* work on the frontier, causing turmoil and havoc across the Outer Systems. Phoron, as beneficial as it is, is still unknown to us-  and its dangers even more so. Even space itself is a cruel, uncaring mistress that countless others have lost their lives in.
This is the universe of today.

##The Frontier
___

You, are stationed in the far, outer edge of colonized human space: Nyx. The sub-solar companion to Nyx, Erebus, is the only known Phoron giant in existance, and has driven much of the colonization and business in the system. *Trans-Stellar Corporations* (TSC's), the *Free Trade Union* (FTU), and countless independent factions have come to Nyx hoping to strike it big, each vying for control of the stars. Even with the Warpgate in the system, Sol Gov has too small of a presence in the system to do much besides police the worst of crimes. Even with the power struggle, the advancements of technology that have improved the overall living and education have spread far out into the Frontier. There yet still, remain a few "backwater" colonies, such as *Brinkburn* and *Roanake*.

All the business, corporate or otherwise, revolves around the near-universally accepted currency known as the *Thaler* which is backed and supported by Sol Gov and its allies. On paper, it is represented by the symbol **"Ã¾"**.

Out in the frontier, employers, be they a captain of a Free Trade vessel, a Trans-Stellar executive, or just someone with thalers to spare and in need of an extra hand, are forced to take just about whoever is willing and apparently able: Basically You. With Sol several months away, running a full background check on a candidate is not viable, which means many questionable people get placed in even the most high-security positions and loyalty is 'by your word', which means in Nyx, corporate backstabbing and criminal activity is quite high. This and a lack of available employees in general means employees who do prove themselves often find themselves promoted quickly, and put into positions that they are even the slightest bit capable in.

##The Basic Need-to-Know
___

###The Races

**Humanity**

![Humanity](https://wiki.baystation12.net/images/6/60/Background-humans.png) 

Humanity, everything and nothing can be said about them. They are the primary driving force for rapid space expansion and perhaps the most populated (known and sentient) species in the galaxy. The vast majority of Trans-Stellar Corporations are owned by humans. By this time men and women are treated all but equal, however there may still be exceptions. 

While most humans are accepting of other species and simply want to earn an honest paycheck, the best and worst are found among them. You never know what a human is going to be like when you first meet them. Due their prevalence in current known space, and their ability to encompass all traits, good and bad, humanity is often considered the 'status quo'.

**Skrell** 

![Skrell](https://wiki.baystation12.net/images/4/4d/Background-Skrell.png)

The Skrell are a species of amphibious humanoids, distinguished by their green-blue gelatinous appearance and head tentacles. Skrell warble from the world of Qerrbalak (or as the lore once called it, Jargon 4), a humid planet with plenty of swamps and jungles. Currently more technologically advanced than humanity, they emphasize the study of the mind above all else.

Gender has little meaning to Skrell outside of reproduction, and in fact many other species have a difficult time telling the difference between male and female Skrell apart. The most obvious signs (voice in a slightly higher register, longer head-tails for females) are never a guarantee. Due to their scientific focus of the mind and body, Skrell tend to be more peaceful and their colonization has been slow, swiftly outpaced by humanity. They were the first contact sentient species, and are humanity's longest, and closest, ally in space.

**Unathi** 

![Unathi](https://wiki.baystation12.net/images/f/f8/Background-unathi.png)

Raging in from Moghes, the Unathi are a race of tall, reptilian humanoids that possess both crocodile-like and serpent-like features. They are a proud, warlike species that favours honour and strength, their home, Moghes, is a desert planet but was once believed to be full of life. Of all the currently known sentient species, the Unathi are the most unequal in gender with females tending to be property of the males.

Most Unathi outside of Moghes tend to be exiles however, and with influence of other species the gender difference is not nearly as pronounced. Unathi were humanity's second contact, and despite their aggressive nature, seem to get along well enough with humanity, though are often considered to be 'second-class' citizens and are rarely seen in jobs other than where muscle is needed.

**Tajara** 

![Tajara](https://wiki.baystation12.net/images/9/92/Background-tajaran.png)

The Tajaran are a humanoid race possessing cat-like features. Hailing from Ahdomai, the smaller of two twin planets, they possess insulative fur and felinoid stability to better survive in their harsh native environment. Their home planet is a cold planet of vast tundra and arctic zones. For generations the tajaran were practically enslaved by the leading class who were recently overthrown. While males and females are treated roughly equal, the true division is between the young and the old. 

Remembering their days of being ruled the older generation pride themselves on loyalty, while the younger generation are often seen as headstrong. Third and most recent contact by humanity. While plenty of Tajaran hold reservations with their new allies, over all the alliance is accepted and welcome. Though like the Unathi plenty of humans take advantage of the less than modern education and slave past history, and it is rare to see a Tajaran in a position of command.

**Dionaea**

![Dionaea](https://wiki.baystation12.net/images/3/33/Dionaea-background.png)

The dionaea are a group of omnivorous, slow-metabolism plantlike organisms that are in fact clusters of individual, smaller organisms. They exhibit a high degree of structural flexibility, and come in a wide variety of shapes and colours to reflect the intelligence of each individual creature. They were discovered by the Skrell in 2294CE, not on a planet, but in open space between three stars, a figurative hell that made it difficult to discover, much less contact them.

Dionaea spread by seeds and are asexual, no gender.
When grown into their small 'nymph' state, they are known to eat large amounts of dead plant matter and fertilize plants while they learn from those around them, and as they grow further merger into larger and larger forms. It is not unheard of for Skrell explorers to be traveling in a ship composed of habitat modules and engines of skrell make and the body formed by their diona allies to warble across the cosmos. Introduced by the Skrell, and quite slow and peaceful, the Diona share good relations with humanity.

**Resomi** (picture will be here along with info)


**Vox**

![Vox](https://wiki.baystation12.net/images/c/cf/Background-vox.png)

A bird-like alien species, these scavengers commonly raid stations and ships for supplies and hardware. Often considered barely organized rabble, they are usually only a threat to ships or stations out alone without any backup, or those with lazy or incompetent security personnel. Cowardly, they tend to only attack when numbers are in their favour, and if not will either run or attempt to bargain worthless trash to gather what they want.



**Synthetics** (picture will be here along with info)

![Borg](https://wiki.baystation12.net/images/f/f1/Generic_borg.png)

Synthetics are spread throughout known space and serve a myriad variety of roles that range from a tiny drone scrubbing a floor to a nearly omnipotent AI in command of an entire battle cruiser. Most known sentient races use synthetics in some way or fashion, very often as prosthetic bodies when their own bodies fail. There are three basic kinds of synthetic found in the universe today:

Android: An android is a robot that runs off of a positronic brain and is usually introspective, calm, and thoughtful. Positronic brains are currently in a turmoil of whether or not they are considered property or free-willed beings that should not be lawbound.

Cyborg: A cyborg is a robot that uses an organic brain to function via an MMI. Cyborgs come in many shapes and sizes and most of the sentient beings that are cyborgs are free-willed. Some companies have used canine brains and brains of other animals to ensure a cheap workforce that doesn't rely on cutting-edge technology.

Robot: A robot is the term to use for any robot that uses more basic forms of intelligence. These are thought of as property in the vast majority of instances and are usually the robots that do the menial tasks that higher functioning beings choose not to do.

###Various Factions

**Trans-Stellar Corporations**
These are the big corporate forces, major companies whose reach cover numerous star systems and are nearly government forces of their own. While Sol Central does keep them in check to make certain nothing too inhumane or against humanity's interest is being performed, they actually police each other in a way. Keep in mind while many corporations do have their own security forces, some of them armed well enough to make some governmental military forces jealous, they are all used for 'asset protection'.

**The Free Trade Union**
To keep the TSC's in check, and to help protect the smaller businesses striving to just make a living, the Free Trade Union was formed 200 years ago. Each FTU branch is different from system to system, but each offer lawyers, copyright enforcement, and even anti-pirate asset protection forces for any non TSC business. All FTU stations are renowned for their open markets where all are welcomed to sell and trade, even the Vox. They're the vocal defenders of the mom and pop stores, basically.

**Sol Gov**
The banner over which most of humanity is united under. They focus on keeping humanity's best interest in check and tend to keep out of a system's personal problems unless they are in a dire state of emergency. (Think United Nations)

**Subversive Forces**
Ever since humanily only lived on Earth, criminals banded together into groups that worked in the opposite side of law. Present time is no exception and there is a number of subversive organisations, pirate groups, rogue states and so on. They operate in various systems, or even between them. Their motives, beliefs, history and power vary, but they all share one trait. They are enemies of normal people. And great inspiration for todays criminals.
