## History

The planet was first colonized in 2493 after a Gateway became operational in the system. The colonization effort was independently founded by Joffrey Smallwaters, who came to wealth through the stock market and his times in several mega corporations as management expert. Most of the initial settlers came from overpopulated regions in Sol, such as the Martian mega-metropolises, looking for a simpler and romanticized farm life, sick of the capitalistic, urbanized and technology-based lifestyle.

Due to the near terrestrial environment, foundation of a colony went with relative ease and little funds. Almost 10000 people settled in the first wave, alongside Joffrey Smallwaters, now called Arthur Pendragon the First, drafting the Declaration of Ascendance, the constitution of Avalon and founding the capital New Jorvik. Thinly spread, many homesteads were established on the southern coast, due to the fertile land and the easy access to fresh water and its importance in transportation and travel. Over the lifetime of Arthur I., several homesteads were established as counties, with governors gaining "nobility" through him.

High population growth rates were present since the foundation of the colony, with the immense majority of the resources remaining on planet. Off-planet trade remained as a limited sight for the next few decades, with alien races such as the Unathi and Tajaran eventually being brought to the planet by entities such as TSCs or the FTU.

The alien minorities still continue to be exceptionally small in 2559, with other general human immigration still being fairly low. Racial tensions are high, as the general human populace deeply mistrusts the xenos and do not tolerate their presence on the planet. This is particularly the case due to them used as law enforcement and backbone of military units, usually seen as thugs. The exception are the few dionae on planetside, which are seen as blessings, due to their useful role in agriculture and their curious, peaceful nature and similarities to old folklore about treants and forest spirits.

Joffrey's children and grandchildren still are ruling the kingdom, adopting the name "Arthur" when they ascend to the throne. Noble houses are established by knighting individuals which have catched either the eye of an already established noble or the king. It is not unheard of that a particular successful farmer, who has built up wealth to be uplifted to a baron in his county and going up from there. In recent times, selling knighthoods and noble titles, even to outsiders of Avalon is another source of revenue for the royal house and is pursued rather aggressively.

## Politics

Avalon's political system is a meshing of older traditions with modern democracy, constituted after the image of its founder, Joffrey Smallwaters. Considered a vanity state by politicians and philosophers alike, Joffrey, or as he was later called Arthur Pendragon, modelled his society after the so called neo-feudalism, a romanticized view of medieval times. The head of state is the King, who serves as highest court, as well the executive power within his domain, while counts and dukes serve as governors of their respective domains, abiding the centralized administration and serving as local judiciary. These titles are hereditary and for life and are passed down to the appointed successor of the predecessor. This is, most of the time, the most able or most favourite child of the passed away governor or king.

The legislature is a body made up by two individuals per county and duchy, the "Crown Court". The first individual is an appointed delegate of the noble for his county (usually himself), the second a democratically voted representative for the small folk. Nobles are exempt of this position and are not allowed to meddle in the election campaigns. Term limits are four years, there is no restriction for consecutive terms or how often someone serves a term. The legislature functions like a simple parliament and has the right to vote laws in, which can be vetoed by the king. In turn, the king can decree laws, which can be vetoed by the senate with a ? majority. The king is allowed to disassemble the Crown Court at any time, but a new one must be assembled as soon as it gets and during this time the king cannot decree any laws.

Law enforcement and military are considered one and the same, as soldiers often serve as law enforcement during peacetime. Military officers draw most of their manpower from the nobility, although it is not a requirement. Every governor is allowed to form their own militia, often consisting of a backbone of alien mercenaries and a small standing army, with levies of the populace raised ad hoc. Drafting is considered a drastic step, but not entirely unheard of, a fact that the smallfolk does not quite willingly accept. Military equipment varies from military outfit to military outfit, but even the most destitute baron can afford a few ballistic firearms. The royal army however is the biggest military organization, with possession of armour and even a few atmospheric fighting aircraft. Most of the military logistics are imported, with few factories capable of even producing ammunition.

Technology is strictly regulated on the planet, especially military technology, to ensure the powerbase of the nobility and especially the king. High technology is forbidden, unless accepted by both parliament and king. Much to the dismay, a small group of outlaws have recently established themselves on Avalon, using bluespace teleporters and energy weapons to terrorize the landscape.

## Geography

Elestus II is a small terrestrial planet with a livable gravity force and atmosphere, which allows Earth-based lifeforms to thrive here. Mineral wealth here is more limited that in other planets of the sector. 80% of the planet is covered in water, the two main continents laying in the temperate region of the planet, while the equator is covered in islands and archipelagos. Curiously enough, there are not many mountains on the planet. Avalon is located on the northern main continent and stretches over the south coast, officially claiming the whole planet as sovereign territory.

The temperature on the planet is temperate on most of it's sections, with the equator possessing tropical rainforests, interesting for xenobotanists and biologists, as they are completely untouched.

## Culture

The populace of this planet tends to have simple lives, not being bothered much by the advanced technology present in other parts of the known galaxy. Food is in a large supply and thus is cheap, which allows the populace of this planet to support far larger families. Most non-human individuals that arrive here tend to adapt to this simple lifestyle easily, which allows for a relatively fairer degree of stability and well-being.

Sol Common is spoken primarily here, due to most of the initial settlers coming from Mars. Other languages such as Galactic Common or Tradeband only tend to be used when contacting off-planet entities, and are barely used on the mainland. English is prevalent in the nobility, and non-human languages such as sinta'unathi, rootspeak and Rrhangarr are still spoken by their related minorities.

A popular sport is football/soccer and rugby, with a "national league" not established as of yet.

## Economy

The economy of the Kingdom of Avalon is almost exclusively rural based, with a priority on large-scale, surface farming. Mining activity is almost non-existent here, along with any significant modern industrial activity. Architecture is primitive and medieval-esque. Transport and infrastructure tends to be fairly antique as well, as the lack of local industrial resources tend to make maintenance of these devices fairly more expensive. The usage of railroads is relevant for travel, while telecommunications (satellite telephones) are a dream of the far future. Most technology lies within the agricultural sector, to ease large scale farming, which is the main sector of the planet.

Off-planet trading is fairly limited as well, as there are no phoron deposits on this planet to allow for cheap space travel. Trading exists mainly only within the planet, although some of the older ships used in the initial colonization effort are sometimes used to trade with the neighboring planets, TSCs or the FTU. Only through that way could this planet enter in contact with non-human species that would often be willing to serve in military positions.

The main off-planet export is farming crops and livestock, which are primarily sold to any FTU ships in the area. With said exports, the colony is able to afford decades or even centuries-old technology such as ship components, ballistic firearms or farming equipment, like tractors. Another common import is phoron fuel for their ships, military equipment and fossil fuels. Agricultural produce of Avalon is popular in wealthy circles, due to the fact that it is considered organic as it gets. Indeed it is mostly free of pesticides and gene-manipulated crops, which has given the planet a small reputation of having reliable, high-quality exports. However, the planet is still fairly isolated even though there is a functional Gateway nearby, which doesn't give a chance for most of the populace in the known galaxy to be able to ever try out their products.

Another considerable factor of Avalon is their tourism, as wealthier and stressed corporate executives enjoy a place where communication is at its bare minimum and where they can enjoy a few weeks of simple farm life or participate in the noble courts of the planet. Guests are seen as strange brethren of outer space, but are welcomed warmly by most Avalonians, as they enjoy company of strangers, further establishing the world as holiday goal. Of course, again, the isolation is dampening the knowledge of the Kingdom, making it more of a secret tip for wealthier circles than actually opening the kingdom as tourist resort for the broader mass of humanity.
