## History


For the sake of brevity, Earth’s history will begin with its original expansion into space, in the mid-20th century. The two major powers of the First Cold War, the Soviet Union, and United States of America, were the first to send men and women into space. During the interbellum, many states, and one of Earth’s first attempts at a world government, the United Nations, contributed to the exploration of space. By the time the first habitats were constructed on the moon in the 2030s, the Second Cold War had begun, and smaller conflicts contributed to global instability. As the effects of population and industry on the environment worsen, many states begin to retreat inwards, or collapse entirely. While the United Nations attempts to maintain some manner of control, it fully collapses shortly after the first Mars landings in 2052. Those countries that can afford space exploration dwindle, and corporations, as well as wealthy private citizens fund the majority of space travel.


While the Russian Federation and United States of America continue to posture, civil unrest and terrorism are omnipresent in both states, and a dwindling amount of influence on the world stage fans fears that the war will go hot in an attempt to hold onto remaining power. However, in 2064, the sudden collapse of the great balancing power at the time, the People’s Republic of China, meant that a hot war would never occur. Instead a humanitarian crisis on a scale never before seen on Earth crashes over the remaining states. Ecological devastation drives many out of Southeast Asia, causing a collapse of many Asian and European states as refugees flood past border controls. The remaining states isolate themselves, resorting to martial law or collapsing. Starvation is common as the hunger years reach their peak. Space travel is almost entirely left to corporations as governments grope for what resources are left. The depletion of fossil fuels limits travel, and most scientific advancement focuses on food growth and energy production.


As food resources stabilize in the 2070s due to a growing agricultural industry in Africa, few remaining powers hold sway, and none on the level of the old hegemonies. The Second Cold War has effectively ended due to a change of government in Russia, and the separation of american states. A concerted effort is made to resume space exploration, and with the assistance of corporations, a small union of states begins to send more and more humans into space. Life on Earth is hard, and often short. While technological advances have allowed some corporations to prosper, many suffer in slums, and the bottom levels of society. A global population of well over ten billion has forced concentration, building upwards, and packing more tightly. 


Finally, as improvements in power generation and genetically modified foodstuffs allow an increase in quality of life, states begin to right themselves. Fusion generators allow cheaper, almost limitless energy, and unlock the door for more powerful engines. Cybernetic augmentation becomes more common, allowing humans to more effectively perform in tasks ranging from industrial to military. With many leaders remembering the strife of the 21st century, a push is made for a combined goal, as a species, not just as individual nation-states. The Terran Commonwealth is founded in Geneva in 2130, seated in the old houses of power, and makes its objective clear: spread to the stars, or perish.


Originally composed of states ranging from Asia to America, the Commonwealth slowly consolidates its power. Member states agree to give up autonomy in exchange for security, a rare commodity in the 2100s. Other holdouts are swayed with promises of economic wealth, or cowed with the threat of being cut out of the world economic order. By 2176, the majority of the remaining nation-states are part of the Commonwealth, with approximately two dozen remaining independent.


While the Commonwealth pushes back out into the solar system, the scope of the environmental catastrophe on Earth becomes more clear. Large swathes of Asia are still devastated by the remains of failed nuclear power plants, destroyed dams, and mass migration. Climate change has made deserts grow, and sea levels rise. Coastal cities like New York, Venice, and Mumbai, have been flooded and abandoned to squatters and looters. Others, like Los Angeles and St. Petersburg have survived by expanding further inland. The Commonwealth’s states and provinces range from barely stable to completely lawless, with many areas still having no government control. While the Commonwealth’s priority was moving population off of Earth, work needed to be done to forestall disaster at home.


The Terran Commonwealth, attempting to simultaneously bring prosperity to the ruined places of the Earth, and to provide sustainable living for those remaining on Earth begin a massive series of construction and development projects. Arcologies were the first priority, in order to concentrate the population, and provide more sustainable options for living. While some existing megacities were developed upwards, this process tended to be prohibitively expensive, and as a result, many cities developed outwards, with construction of new, planned sections being used to employ much of the population, and the older parts of cities slowly being abandoned and demolished. Many completely new cities were built as well, either taking advantage of new land, or springing up out of necessity. The most important of these during the early reconstruction was New Benin. Situated hundreds of miles from its original namesake, New Benin was planned by the Terran Commonwealth as the site of the first space elevator built by mankind.


Construction of the elevator began in 2141, and by the time it was complete in 2193, New Benin had sprouted around it. Rising out of the jungles of the Congo, the city was a triumph of sustainable engineering, built in concentric circles around the elevator, the city was split into layers, with large high rises connected to interconnected platform layer at approximately the 80 story mark. Following suit, many of the other rebuilt and newly constructed arcologies adopted a similar “megacity” design with dense vertical development, and massive suspended platforms connected to the skyscrapers.


Other, smaller cities used more compact designs when rebuilding, but maintained the same environmentally neutral mindset, producing no waste that can’t be used, and producing enough food to sustain its population. A few cities that had been partially or completely flooded, such as Los Angeles and Saint Petersburg abandoned the remaining areas left habitable by levees and pumps, and instead began to build floating structures, coexisting with the risen ocean instead of battling against it.


In orbit, extensive construction moved not only a significant portion of the population into space, but also the majority of industry and manufacturing. Spacecraft were built at a rapid pace, fueling a boom in space travel and commerce.


The Colony Conflicts allow the Commonwealth to further solidify its control on Earth. Holdout states are further marginalized, with resources being secured for “security purposes,” and by the time the war is over, there are no states that remain unincorporated.


Growth only continued during and after the Conflict, warfare is always good for business, and after the victory of the Commonwealth over the martian powers, Earth had full control over Sol. With increased wealth and power comes increased prosperity.


When Project Ptolemy was launched in the mid-24th century, Earth was beginning to heal. While hundreds of cities had been abandoned and demolished, dozens of new cities were built, or constructed on top of the old. A major depopulation had occurred in the countryside, leaving many areas desolate, to be slowly reclaimed by nature.


While many took advantage of the Terran Commonwealth’s colonization programs, and then the offworld housing and employment programs of SolGov, some did remain on Earth. The reasons for staying were as unique as they were for leaving, some religious groups considered Earth sacred ground, and leaving to be against the plan of some deity or another, separatist groups formed independent communities, attempting only to live on their own, unbothered by the government, and others still simply saw Earth as their true home, and made it their mission to reclaim it from the concrete and plastic debris of past centuries.


After the transition of government from the Terran Commonwealth to the Sol Central Government, and the movement of the capital to Mars, the question of government came up again. Instead of being treated like a Colony, or a Solar member of the SCG, much of the Terran Commonwealth’s governing structure was kept in place. The remaining fragments of old nation-states are completely removed, and territory was split into administrative provinces, all under the auspices of the “Protectorate of Earth.” This new government, while having the trappings of a democratic government, was tasked primarily with returning Earth to its former ecological glory, with the eventual goal of making Earth a beautiful garden, for all humanity to enjoy.


Today, the total population on Earth sits at about 3 billion, with almost another billion in orbit spread across thousands of space stations. Multiple corporations jockey for terraforming contracts, working to decontaminate any remaining dead zones, and repair environmental damage. Some areas have returned to levels not seen since the 18th century, and global temperatures have begun to fall. Thanks to a concerted effort, the ice caps have partially returned, though sea levels remain high. Almost the entire population is concentrated in arcologies, with smaller towns, research stations, and compounds few and far between. Homeworld tourism has begun to increase as areas are reclaimed, and archaeological societies continue to preserve what remains of the cities and monuments of the old world. While not the center of human society, Earth has, and always will have, a special place in the cultural identity of humankind.

## Government and Politics


The Protectorate of Earth is a Parliamentary Republic, encompassing the entirety of Earth, as well as the structures in immediate orbit. It is divided into 10 “provinces”, eight terrestrial provinces, and two orbital provinces. The eight on earth consist of half-hemispheres, and the orbital provinces are split into inner and outer orbits. Each province holds ten seats in parliament, with elections held every three years. Unlike many governments, Earth is not heavily focused on external growth and politicking, instead most energy is focused on the ecological restoration work still to be done. Even the Protectorate Constitution’s first line states: “Earth is the birthplace of mankind, and it is every Human’s duty to preserve and protect it for future generations.”

### Foreign Relations

The Protectorate of Earth is a member of the Sol Central Government, and has a seat on the Solar Assembly. It is seen as a generally neutral member, slow to act, and uninterested in Solar affairs other than funding for the restoration of Earth.
### Defense and Law Enforcement

While provinces handle their own law enforcement, detachments of the Home Guard provide security for the planet as a whole, as well as specialized forces such as SWAT and Customs Control. Additionally, the SCG Defense Forces provide the services of a military for the Protectorate, and enjoy the use of Earth for a large number of facilities, including training camps, docks, academies, and storage depots.

## Geography
* **Resources**: The majority of accessible non-renewable resources on Earth have been depleted. The remaining renewable resources such as lumber are off limits for economic exploitation. Food is produced in a sustainable manner within individual arcologies.
* **Flora and Fauna**: Despite multiple minor extinction events, as well as the toll of climate change and warfare upon the environment, Earth enjoys one of the more vibrant ecosystems known to man. In the last century, geneticists have worked diligently to revive many extinct species, and terraforming specialists have restored many of the biospheres thought lost.


Although its oceans have risen significantly in the last few centuries, the general shape of Earth’s continents remain. These continents encompass biomes ranging from arctic to desert, with much of the planet covered in tropical rainforests, temperate forests, and grasslands. Large deserts and badlands cover much of the land devastated by the crises of the 21st century, however in recent years they have begun to recede. Remains of widespread human habitation remain visible in some places on the planet surface, largely in the form of roads, most uninhabited cities have been completely demolished, or intentionally incorporated into natural features.

### Climate

Earth has four seasons, varying in length and intensity based on geographic location. While by the end of the 21st century, most locations only experienced about 2 and a half seasons, with no extreme cold period, and only brief periods of extreme heat, diligent work by climate scientists has restored a full four seasons to many regions closer to the poles.
### Terrain

Primarily covered in water, Earth is a wet planet. Vegetation is omnipresent in the terrestrial and oceanic areas that have been ecologically restored. Being the densest terrestrial planet in the Solar System, Earth has a relatively high gravity, especially compared to its more influential neighbor, Mars.

## Culture

Earth culture is as varied and different as it always has been. Arcologies remain spread across the world, and although ethnicities have largely blended, individual cultural traditions are often shared within individual arcologies and provinces.


One relatively new cultural phenomenon is the “homeworlder” movement. These humans believe that it was a mistake to leave Earth, and that it’s the duty of mankind to live in harmony on and with their homeworld. These groups often are mistaken for the independent homesteader movements due to their insistence on living in self sufficient communities outside of the arcologies, however homeworlder movements are much better regarded within the Protectorate.

### Entertainment

Homeworld tourism is a booming business on Earth, both to see natural and man-made wonders. Much care is taken to prevent damage to fragile ecosystems, and quotas of tourists for more popular sites are filled more than a year in advance. Several historic cities have been preserved for tourism. Some of these are within larger arcologies, such as Jerusalem, which falls within Sinai, and others have been left standing independently, maintained by curators, such as Moscow.

## Economy
* **Imports**: Terraforming Equipment, Environmental Specialists, Engineering Supplies, Genetic Material
* **Exports**: Excess Flora and Fauna, Replica Artifacts, Tchotchkes, Reclaimed Nuclear Material


The majority of business done on Earth revolves around the restoration of contaminated or ecologically devastated areas, or rebuilding genetic diversity. Tourism makes up another major chunk of the economy, with almost a billion humans visiting the Earth during the course of a year.


Due to the fragile nature of the ecosystem, most commercial traffic, loading and unloading, and industrial manufacturing is done in orbit, in the countless space stations or orbital lattices. Employment remains high, both due to the relatively low population, and the demand for labor in environmental projects.


Various corporations vie for lucrative terraforming and cleanup projects, although none have pulled ahead in recent years. As more and more long-term projects are completed, new contracts are fewer and less common.

## Science and Technology

While no longer the core of human society, Earth enjoys the access to modern technology provided by its location in the Solar System. Outstripped by the research facilities of the inner colonies, Earth does provide ecologists, conservationists, geneticists, and terraformers with a valuable example of successful long term restoration of an ecosystem.


In order to preserve the delicate atmospheric work, most orbit-ground transit takes place through the Galapagos and New Benin space elevators. Transport on the surface typically uses repulsorcraft, although a plan to construct public teleporters, with the support of NanoTrasen, has been introduced to parliament.


Arcologies generate their own electricity through a combination of wind, solar, and in some cases geothermal or tidal generators, and many of the smaller settlements follow suit. New Benin and Galapagos require more power to operate their space elevators, and have a number of fusion generators spread around the elevator structure. Suggestions to use phoron or suppermater-based power have been almost universally rejected in order to avoid environmental disasters.

## Habitation

Considered the most advanced structures in history when they were built, today, Earth’s arcologies are showing their age. Continually upgraded and repaired, most arcologies work, but only just. With much of the ecological restoration work done, focus in government is shifting to improving habitation, however it may be a decade or more before any large-scale work begins.


Arcologies, from the mind-bogglingly huge megacities, to small, isolated towns, are built to be self-sustaining. External building walls are covered in solar panels, greenery, or both. Windmills dot the structures, and grow rooms are almost as common as habitation. In the lower levels, water is reclaimed and recycled, as is most waste. Each Arcology tends to have its own architectural style, however most of the larger ones follow the general shape and design of New Benin: concentric circles of highrises, with suspended platforms connecting them at various levels.


Smaller compounds are almost all self-sustaining, given the expense of importing food, water and energy, although some corporate terraforming ventures take the time to import supplies. These compounds often raise livestock, which has become a somewhat unusual practice on Earth given the premium of space, and sometimes causing controversy due to environmental impact in fragile areas.


In orbit, an unusually large industrial complex has developed, due to the lack of manufacturing planetside, resulting in some of the largest orbital construction in human space. Vast amounts of commercial traffic transport goods and people to and fro, with most supplies being sent up and down with the space elevators. As a result, there are massive living habitats alongside and within industrial stations. Counting visitors staying in orbital hotels, and docked spacecraft, the total orbital population is almost a billion.

## Hazards and Crime

Earth, like anywhere else has its share of crime, though much less so than during the worst periods of the past. Many organized crime groups have followed humanity into space, and left their historical homes behind, however some remain for the sake of tradition or mystique. The Yakuza, are one such criminal organization; which had roots in pre-industrial Japan, a now-flooded island nation off the eastern coast of Asia, has since moved its headquarters to Shanghai, on the mainland.


Petty crime is more common in areas with heavy tourism, travel bureaus often warn potential visitors to avoid less-traveled areas of arcologies, such as the lower industrial levels, in order to avoid pickpockets.


A small but brisk smuggling ring skims terraforming equipment and scientific instruments from environmental projects, in order to ship elsewhere. While typically more expensive than goods stolen from frontier terraforming, shipping from Sol is cheaper for destinations in the core worlds.

## Restricted Information

While not strictly classified, the SCG Defense Forces operate many training facilities and other installations on Earth, many of which are no-fly zones for tourists and locals alike.

## Notable Features
Any sub-locations like a moon, building, or landmark that you'd like to add.


### Sub Feature 1
This would be an interesting feature of some kind, like a natural or man made satellite.


### Space Elevators

The megacity of New Benin, and the floating island arcologies of Galapagos are tethered to space by massive space elevators. Located upon the equator, these elevators are connected to equally massive transit stations in orbit, enabling the vast flow of goods and materials needed for the environmental work on Earth. Due to the restrictions on spacecraft travel, the space elevators are where most tourists and travellers pass through when visiting Earth. Lately, there has been talk of replacing the elevators with large-scale teleporters, however the novelty and inaccuracy of the technology means that any such replacement is decades away at least.


### Megacities

The largest of the arcologies are called “megacities.” Distinguished by their multilayer design, megacities often incorporate portions of older cities, and tend to grow more advanced, and better looking, at their higher levels. The oldest megacities are Los Angeles, Bosny, Kolkata, Brasilia, Shanghai, Darwin, and St. Petersburg, all built from, or adjacent to the remains of older cities. Sinai and Meridiem, located across the Asian/African nexus, and Mt. Tyree in Antarctica respectively, were newly built by the Terran Commonwealth in order to handle population surpluses on largely unused land. Another arcology, called Yucatan was also built at the same time, but is considered too small for the moniker “megacity.”


One of the most notable megacities, home to almost 300 million people, is Bosny, a massive series of interconnected coastal arcologies, stretching from the Chesapeake Sea to Wachusett Island. The city’s namesake “Bosny” stems from its founding cities, Boston and New York, however, as sea levels continued to rise, levees were allowed to fail, and older cities were replaced with new arcologies, incorporating land from Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington DC.


### Notable Arcologies

With population being concentrated into arcologies, it’s only natural that many older cities were abandoned, or folded into new construction. The most notable remaining cities from pre-Commonwealth history are: London; Vancouver; Dubai; Irkutsk; Yucatan; Geneva; Makhachkala; and Santiago. Many of these cities, and their megacity counterparts, were located on the coastline, or on major rivers, and as such had to adopt “floating designs,” that drift with the currents of the ocean. As the ice caps are restored in size, talks have begun to adapt these cities for the return of the coastline.
