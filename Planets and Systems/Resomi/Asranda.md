## History
* **Discovered**: 2440
* **Founded**: 2442

An official exploration mission first discovered A'sranda in 2440 past the edge of the Resomi Republic. The world was found to have an exceptionally strong magnetic field, and was covered almost entirely by mountainous continents, hardy vegetation, and plentiful wildlife. Because of the planet’s strong magnetic field, most survey data had to be gathered manually on the surface. The planet was particularly interesting to the Republic because of a high concentration of industrial materials that were entirely unexploited. This led to a quick push by the government to establish a colony.

Two years later, in 2442, the first colony ships arrived and set down in the Northern hemisphere, founding the first cities in the name of the Republic. The most prominent of these, Saraeesh, was declared the planetary capital. Mining operations commenced soon after in 2443 and the planet made its first shipment of resources back to civilization in 2445. The initial founding of the planet attracted about two million Resomii, and as the planet was developed, the population grew to almost 15 million. A'sranda was considered the fastest growing planet in the Republic. This was not to last, in 2448, the Republic was consumed from within. As the event eventually known as "The Fall" progressed, the planet recieved less and less news from the Republic. Rumors swirled of chaos in the inner systems, and of AIs gone rogue, until suddenly, the news stopped. A'sranda's gateway shut off without warning, leaving the planet stranded in the vastness of space. Worse still, a number of A'sranda's own AI units began to display erratic behavior, nanomachines and networked equipment stopped working, and then reactivated and attacked the Randians. The major cities fell first, with most surviving Resomii fleeing to the mountains, and taking shelter in the mines. A'sranda's garrison fleet, unable to contact the surface, made a last-ditch attempt to halt the advance of the AI, and launched nuclear explosives into the planet’s exosphere. This caused a massive-planet wide Electromagnetic Pulse, which knocked out most of the AI units and nanoswarms on the planet. Having done what they could, the vessels remaining in orbit fled back towards the center of the Republic, thinking they had left a tomb behind.

However, this was not the end of A'sranda, or the AI threat. The Randian survivors, emerging from mines and other hidden places found that some AI had survived the pulse, and were still gathered in their once great cities, clinging to life. Uniting in a push to retake their once great cities, the Randians were on the verge of reclaiming their planet, but suffered one final blow from the Fall. Unwilling or unable to find another option, the surviving AI detonated power plants, and the reactor cores of landed ships, decimating the planet's cities; the capital Saraeesh was almost entirely wiped out. Over a million Resomii died during the final blasts alone, and when the smoke cleared, fewer than two million had survived. The few Randians left abandoned their once great cities, now charred and radioactive ruins, and made their homes in the mines that had sheltered them, forgotten, and far outside the borders of the newly hewn Empire.

However, those survivors were not doomed, and for once they had a stroke of luck: their fungal crops remained growing in the darkness of the caves, food was plentiful, even if little lese was. With their farms largely untouched, and hunting to supplement the population as it recovered, A'sranda would endure. Crowded together in cramped spaces that were once meant only for few a Resomii and exo suits, the Randians began to expand their tunnels into a new home. Resomi miners who remained were invaluable, and for a Randian, even today, miners are among the most respected Resomii. As the population stabilized, the underground cities expanded, and a few brave Resomii began to venture back out into the sunlight, forming a few sizeable surface communities. Those that remained underground in the mines reestablished communication with one another, and began the long process of rebuilding. The largest mine city, Azer’na, became the capital of the new Republic of A'sranda.

As the years passed, Resomii began to explore the ruined cities of their past, finding that, while heavily damaged, some technology remained, including a factory that once built exosuits. Word was sent back to the young government, and scavengers and engineers were sent to take apart and study every detail of the machines. Randians once again began to build exosuits, and mass produce goods. Civilization recovered, little by little. While still centuries behind the technology they once knew, Randians thrived again.

For a time, there was unbridled optimism, the Resomii on A'sranda remained entirely cut off from the rest of civilization, for all they knew, the Republic had been entirely destroyed by the synths. It isn't known if the Empire ever returned to determine the fate of the colony, but they never contacted those left on the surface. It wasn’t until 2511 that Randians encountered outsiders again, and unlucky for them, their visitors were not friendly. Vox raiders, now assumed to have been part of a large shoal that passed by A'sranda, descended upon the still young surface settlements. Many of the smaller towns aboveground were devastated by raids. Resomii outside the safety of the largest towns died or were taken, along with some of the precious few working pieces of technology left. Almost as quickly as they came, the Vox left, moving on with their Shoal.

In the wake of the disaster, life changed on the surface. The raid was blamed on everything that it could possibly be blamed on: lights, radio waves, and advanced technology could have all been culprits. The Chancellor, head of the A'srandian Republic took action and passed several new edicts. Radio-based communication was banned aboveground, blackout curtains were mandatory for every surface building, and had to be drawn from dusk to dawn, outdoor lighting was entirely banned. What little footprint the Randians had on the surface was effectively erased. Military patrols, using newly designed combat exosuits, religiously protected those settlements which remained.

It is only by coincidence that the Randians were discovered again. In 2555, a few dozen freelance miners discovered A'sranda, and landed near a particularly rich mineral deposit. Having detected no signs of life or civilization through the atmosphere, the miners were caught unprepared and were captured by a security patrol. At least one of the minres managed to get a distress call off through the heavy interference, and the Sol Central Government dispatched a task force to investigate. After making more formal contact with the surface, the situation remained tense for some time, until SolGov recruited a Resomi translator and managed to defuse the situation. The miners were released, and terse diplomatic ties were established.

Today, the small Republic of A'sranda sits mostly in isolation. Limited contact with outsiders, and an incredibly distrustful populace due to encounters with Vox have led to this situation, but situations are improving; slowly. NanoTrasen, with Sol Gov authorization, has been allowed to build a trading outpost in the Republic, creating a shallow yet flourishing trade. Randian minerals and advanced technology pass through the trading outpost on a weekly basis. Some Resomi have even managed to get offworld to see the stars, with a contract from a Trans-Stellar Corporation of course.

## Government and Politics
The local Government of A’sranda is a Republic on paper, but is essentially a representative Oligarchy. Representatives are elected by mostly legitimate popular vote, and sit on "The Body." Without term limits, most representatives serve until their deaths, so long as they serve the interests of the major political players on the planet. The foremen of thee underground cities hold massive amounts of political power, and representatives seem to stay in power only if the miners will it. Few notice this fact, but they tend to stay quiet, they don’t want to have any accidents happen. The Chancellor is the head of the Body, and is elected by their peers once a year. The current Chancellor is seen as dangerous for encouraging communication with outsiders, and only time will tell if they remain in power.

### Foreign Relations
A'sranda is only tentatively making steps to communicate with the rest of the interstellar community, and because it still does not possess the technology required for space travel, makes use of intermediaries like SolGov and NanoTrasen.

* FTU/Corporate space: Formal trade has been established with one Trans-Stellar: NanoTrasen. Several other corporations use NT as an intermediary, and Resomii are permitted to leave the planet to work.
* Sol Central Government: Diplomatic talks ongoing. Humans not working for NanoTrasen are not permitted to visit for extended periods or travel underground.
* Skrell City-States: Minor contact. Skrell are not allowed on A'sranda unless they are working for a corporation.
* Vox Shoals: At War; Vox are seen as aggressive, violent creatures that prey on Resomi without mercy. The horrors of the raids are still fresh and Vox are despised and seen worthy of only death.
* Ahdomai: No contact. Tajaran are barred from visiting A’sranda without corporate employment.
* Moghes Hegemony: No contact. Unathi are barred from visiting A’sranda without corporate employment.
* The Positronic Union: No formal contact. Synthetic intelligences of any kind are not permitted on A'sranda.
* The Resomi Empire: No contact. A'sranda is aware of its existence but does not wish to make contact.

### Defense and Law Enforcement
The National Army of A’sranda is a small organization, consisting of only around 70,000 Resomii. Its main units use modified mining exosuits to deal with any conflicts that arise. More recently they have found themselves tasked with locating and capturing any unauthorized visitors from offworld. Otherwise, small police forces keep the peace in their own cities, often using similarly modified exosuits.

## Geography
* **Resources**: A’sranda has an abundance of natural resources, mostly metals and precious gemstones. The planet has high amounts of naturally occuring platinum, uranium, iron, gold, and silver throughout its crust.
* **Flora and Fauna**: Most of the wildlife on A’sranda is native to the planet. Wildlife and vegetation has reclaimed most of the ruined cities of pre-Fall A'sranda. Unusual for a planet of its size, A'srandian flora and fauna are on average smaller than similar species, fitting for the Resomi inhabitants, but off-puting for many visitors.

A’sranda is a world of many mountains and few lakes. It lies closer to the goldilocks zone than Sirasi but is a cold world with many peaks and heavy tectonic activity. The Resomi population lies almost entirely on the northern hemisphere of the planet, but a few cities dot the generally warmer regions of the southern hemisphere. A single ocean runs almost from pole to pole, but is completely bordered by land. A'sranda's most interesting feature on a planetary scale is its geomagnetic field, with is unusually strong. This accompanies a dense ionosphere and upper atmosphere, meaning that less solar radiation reaches the surface, resulting in smaller plants and animals. However, this magnetic field has also protected A'sranda, both from the prying eyes of outsiders, and from the nuclear detonations in its past.

### Climate
An alpine world, it has four seasons with minimal variations. Liquid surface water is scarce and larger plant life is more restricted to the temperate equatorial regions. Underground water sources sustain a few, hardy patches of vegetation further north.
### Terrain
Mountains dot the entire planet, thanks in part to robust tectonic activity. Other than its single ocean, saltwater is uncommon on A'sranda, though larger freshwater lakes can approach the size of small seas.

## Culture
Culture on A’sranda resembles that of the Republic. Society is generally free-er than that of the Empire, and despite a corrupt political system, Randians enjoy a higher level of social mobility than most other Resomii. Politicians are often patrons of the arts, supporting a respectable craft industry, and Resomi family life is regarded as an important tradition to be upheld. Unlike the Empire,  familial professions are alive and well on A'sranda. First, second, and third hatchlings often learn the crafts of their parents, while those that come afterwards are encouraged to learn the crafts of child-less relatives, or pursue their personal interests.

### Entertainment
Wingball is enjoyed by much of the planet, and a thriving planetary circuit enraptures young and old alike. Large networks of wired communication lines connect the many underground and aboveground settlements, and allow events to be broadcast globally. It is common when wingball is playing for Resomii to crowd into large communal areas to hear the live coverage of games. More recently, low level representatives have made pushes to unban radio based technology, but there has been no change in official policy so far.

## Economy
* **Imports**: Machinery, technology, laser weaponry, rare materials, engineering expertise.
* **Exports**: Raw materials and skilled labor.

Money is made on A’sranda only in two ways: hard work or inheritance. The planet is not a major trade hub yet but commerence is growing at a rapid pace. NanoTransen has plans to expand its trade outpost, and several other Trans-Stellars have expressed interest in building stations in orbit. Most Resomii on A’sranda are part of the lower class, miners or craftsmen. A small middle class exists, but the upper class is mostly in control of the money.


## Science and Technology
A’sranda is a few centuries behind the current level of interstellar technology. If compared to Earth's development, it can be compared to the mid-21st century. Other than exosuits, most technology only uses simple electronics or hydraulics. Communication is limited to wired systems only, with one exception: the bluespace communication array at the NanoTrasen outpost. Factories are few in number and mostly provide to service the planet’s overreliance on exo suits for nearly everything. Mass production has been slowly improved since the arrival of NanoTrasen, but has a ways to go. Most city to city transport is in the form of large rail networks, magnetized for speed, efficiency, and so as to not hurt the sensitive ears of their passengers. Power is mostly generated by geothermal stations set up before the Fall, and are managed entirely by a few Resomii in expensive, pre-Fall exosuits rated for high temperature work. The education system tends to produce a lot of engineers out of necessity they are required to build or repair the many pieces of older technology that society depends on.

## Habitation
Resomii on A’sranda live mostly underground, in carved rock chambers ranging from cramped, barracks-like tunnels to more opulent diggings that resemble apartments. Wealthier areas have sound-dampening barriers to protect the ears of upper class Resomii from mining noise. Outside, on the surface, Randians live mostly in low, dormitory style buildings made from concrete and metal.

## Hazards and Crime
Organized crime, especially in the labor sectors is a growing problem on A’sranda. A few powerful syndicates run things in the seedier underground cities, and in such places racketeering, corruption, intimidation, and bribery are common. On the surface, the ruins of the old cities are forbidden for both outsiders and Randians. Whether this is out of superstition, fear of hidden AI, or a healthy caution around irradiated structures is up to personal interpretation. 

## Notable Features

### Azer'na
The Capital of A'sranda, Azer'na is where the Body meets to discuss matters of state, and was one of the first mines to be dug by colonial engineers. It is now long since empty, and has been largely built up as an example of how art and luxury are possible underground.

### Earatniea
A larger underground city built on the shores of a massive underground lake, Earatniea is the only source of seafood for much of the population of A'sranda. It is also the most populated city, with over half a million Resomii calling it home.

### Rinea
The largest surface city, Rinea is the site of the NanoTrasen trade outpost, and has prospered as a result. Rinean citizens are often looked down upon by their underground brethren due to their close contact with outsiders.

### The Golden Tombs
The local name for the original colonial cities, these once grand monuments to the Republic now lie in ruin. Many are close to current underground cities, but they are forbidden to enter without express permission by the Chancellor. While some legends suggest that the crumbling remains of these cities are haunted, NanoTrasen has expressed a desire to explore them to the Chancellor.
