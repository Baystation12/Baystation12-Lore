## History
Mirania was first founded in the late 24th century, when a colony ship bearing immigrants from all over Europe (But chiefly Germany, France, Italy, and Denmark) arrived at the planet. What they found was a wet planet with vast, sprawling plains and wetlands. The gravity was already only slightly lower than earth, temperatures were cold, but livable. Mirania required little terraforming to tame. The fledgling First Republic of Mirania quickly became a popular and attractive destination for settlers, and grew quickly. This early version of Mirania was sparsely populated, filled with farming communities, with the rare urban centre. The discovery of large amounts of platinum and other precious metals just beneath the planet's surface sparked a Miranian Mineral Rush in the mid 25th century, which inflated the population dramatically. Mirania was a hub of exports on the frontier. For the first time in its history, Mirania was prospering and a hive of activity. The new government, however, became discontent with exporting raw materials, and wanted to increase profit from mining with manufacturing. A massive, government sponsored industrialisation campaign started, and factories cropped up around the mines. As the years went by and strip mining gradually depleted the deposits, the factories became the main driving force behind Mirania's economy. The mining, while no longer prevalent, had served to kickstart a robust and expansive manufacturing economy, one of the largest of the frontier worlds. As the factories grew, so did their demands for labour, and population continued to expand, with vast, sprawling urban areas cropping up around the factory districts. In the latter half of the 25th century, Mirania joined the Sol Central Government with a referendum passed narrowly at 24-27 in the Miranian Senate. The decision was controversial, largely due to concerns among the immensely prideful Miranian people about how well Sol would look after their interests. Today, Mirania's surface is almost entirely urbanised, with little green visible from orbit, apart from government maintained parks or stretches of private land that have remained undeveloped. The manufacturing economy is beginning to falter, due to its dependence on resources from other planets in the system, which have been diverted to the central worlds of the SCG by the mining companies due to competition on Sol's open market and better prices. Recently, the tensions that resulted from joining the SCG have come to a head, with a clash between Miranian and mainstream human cultures, rising nationalist sentiment among the population, as well as a perceived neglect on the part of Sol leading to a military coup on the planet and secession from Sol. The Bundeforz Difeza (Federal Defence Force) has organised a new government, with members or former members of the Defence Force being placed in all government positions. Relations with Sol are tense, as Mirania continues to blame Sol for all of its problems, and claims the entirety of the Mirania system, as well as several neighbouring star systems. The new government has also changed the flag of Mirania. The original flag was a tricolour meant to represent the cooperation between various earth governments to found the colony. The new government has added a red triangle to the hoist side, symbolising how the new culture and government of Mirania binds all of those disparate backgrounds together into one unified force, as well as a black sun, a prominent symbol of the nationalist movement.

## Government and Politics
When Mirania was first founded, the First Republic was established, which had a unicameral congress. One senate of 50 ministers, with the Prime Ministers serving as a tiebreaker. Ministers were elected directly by the citizens of their prefecture. Each prefecture had its own local senate, with ministers also elected directly by the citizens. The directly elected prefect served as prime minister for a local senate. The prime minister appointed ministers from the senate to special positions giving them additional administrative authority, these included: The Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Relations, and the Ministry of Justice. After the coup, the structure of the Republic remains much the same, with the key difference being that a bottom up elected government has become a top down appointed government. All ministers are appointed by the prime minister, prefects are appointed by ministers, and local ministers are appointed by prefects, with no elections held for any government positions. In addition, another department of the government has been created, the Ministry of Truth, responsible for intelligence gathering, domestic suppression of political opposition, and distribution of propaganda. A recent popular support for nationalist movements has also reshaped the political climate. For those in the Nationalist Party of Mirania, Sol has become a scapegoat for all of Mirania's problems, including the recently failing economy, the influx of aliens and other immigrants, a perceived military vulnerability from the nearby Vox due to a perceived lack of sufficient SCGDF presence in the area, and the government's acceptance of unpopular policies imposed by the General Assembly. Before the coup, the majority party in the government was the Miranian Social Democratic League, followed closely by the Nationalist Party of Mirania. The NPM became famous for its slogan "Mirania Above All" appearing in graffiti across the planet (particularly on the residences of immigrants and non-humans) with alarming and increasing regularity. The NPM's chief symbol, the black sun, now features prominently on the flag of the New Republic. The black sun represents the NPM's rhetoric, revolving around Mirania becoming "darkened" and drained of its resources and glory, a grim portent of a potential future. The recent military coup is believed to have been mostly orchestrated by members of the NPM, and the new government has centred its political agenda on nationalistic goals.

## Foreign Relations
Mirania does not get along well with Sol these days, as the recent political movements on Mirania have made Sol into a scapegoat for all of the colony's problems. Independent systems nearby see Mirania's nationalist and militarist tendencies and view it as a potential threat to peace and stability in the region. Miranian relationships with the Terran Confederacy have been rather warm, as Mirania seeks to establish relations with another, non-Sol power to cement its diplomatic sovereignty. Relations with alien nations are cool at best, due to the xenophobic nature of the Miranian government.
## Defense and Law Enforcement
Mirania has traditionally had a small defence force, armed with nothing more than ballistic small arms and orbital customs cutters. In recent years, however, Mirania has been increasing their armaments drastically, in response to both nationalist sentiments and a perceived threat from the Vox. The Miranian military is now a fully fledged military force, complete with capital ships, landing craft, armoured vehicles, and artillery. 

## Geography and Climate
Mirania was, at first, a flat, wet world, with frequent rains, and large amounts of low vegetation, but very few trees. Modern Mirania is heavily urbanised, with vast urban sprawl covering most of the planet's surface. Most buildings are tall, to conserve land, which is at a premium on the densely populated planet. What little land isn't covered by cities is covered by massive factory complexes. With the relatively large portion of water for a planet its size, Mirania often has overcast weather, and features very frequent rains. These frequent, torrential rains are handled by the cities with an elaborate and gargantuan storm drain system which has, since the coup, become a haven for underground dissident groups.


## Culture
Miranians are immensely prideful. Their origins as an agrarian and extremely isolated colony has developed in the population an attitude of pride in their planet, as it is perceived as the work of Miranian hands that made the colony great. Newcomers are often subject to disdain, and many of the influx of immigrants were relegated to menial jobs and unskilled labour. Descendants of the original colonists make up a class called "Old Miranians", which make up a significant amount of the wealthy and have a disproportionately high number in government positions. The requirements for citizenship are: being human, being born on Mirania (children of non-citizens satisfy this requirement), fluency in Miranian Creole, a passing score on a test that includes Miranian history and politics, and an oath of loyalty to the government. Many citizens, particularly the "Old Miranians" take an enormous amount of pride in their nation, Miranian flags are common decorations seen in homes across the planet, and the Miranian national anthem and a reaffirming of the oath of loyalty start off the day in every school and workplace. Understandably, nationalist political groups have become extremely prominent. Miranians also place a large amount of emphasis on social structures and institutions. Family is extremely important to every Miranian, and many on the planet are fiercely loyal to even members of their extended families, and would sooner die than betray any member of their family. The state is seen as a macrocosm of the family, and thus, all Miranians are willing to serve the state as if their countrymen were their siblings.

## Entertainment
As dour as Miranians can be in most other areas, their culture has a flourishing entertainment industry. Mirania III's unique culture has spawned equally unique movements in music and theatre, particularly in opera. Miranian opera tends to be deep and introspective, with a slow, thorough pace that emphasises the characters' inner thoughts and workings, while contrasting those with how their outwards actions impact the lives of others. There's a notable emphasis on duty and loyalty, either to the state, to companions, or to family. Miranian composers are not afraid to allow their pieces to be discordant when it properly reflects the intended mood, and the music is primarily focused on evoking emotion.

## Economy
The Miranian economy is driven first and foremost by manufacturing and mining. The mines on Mirania III have long since been stripped bare of their largest deposits, so the many factories on the planet must rely on the mining shipments from Mirania I and II for a steady influx of raw materials. Among other things, Miranian factories chiefly turn out light starships, with the occasional heavier one being built in orbit, atmospheric craft for both leisure and defence, firearms (with a focus on ballistics), computer systems for starships and industrial use, industrial robotic units for use in factories and other facilities, as well as cybernetic components and synthetics in a limited capacity. Since Mirania joined with the Sol Central Government, competition on the open market has caused many of the mining companies elsewhere in the system to start selling to private buyers elsewhere in Sol space, where previously they had to supply the factories on Mirania III before any foreign trade could be conducted. This has resulted in the formerly strong Miranian manufacturing economy beginning to falter, as unemployment rises, and previously productive factories sit empty. This recent economic hardship has led a lot of those left impoverished and unemployed turning to nationalist parties, which promise to put Mirania first and restore the economy to what it once was.
## Science and Technology
Though not as advanced as some of the more coreward worlds, Mirania is a centre of science and technology along the frontier. Focus is on manufacturing, particularly industrial robotics. Mirania's militarism has also prompted developments in starship engineering and weapons. The weapons made on the planet typically favour ballistic or magnetic firearms, and they have a well earned reputation for being reliable, even if dragged through the worst environmental conditions possible. The planet's factories also churn out transports of all kinds, as well as military vehicles for both land, sea, space, and air.

## Habitation
Habitation conditions can vary drastically across Mirania, as with many other worlds, based on socioeconomic factors. A high rise apartment complex is not atypical, furnished thoroughly with basic amenities. The size and luxury of these apartments vary considerably, from lavish penthouses, to sparse, one room apartments. Because land is at such a premium on Mirania, almost no one lives in their own house, and doing so would be seen as a grotesque display of wealth at the expense of society. People are mostly content with the soaring scyscrapers filled with apartments, though it does get cramped and unpleasant in the poorer areas.

## Hazards and Crime
Violent crime is very rare on Mirania, as the government tends to be security conscious to a nearly invasive level. There are cameras observing most major streets, heavily armed federal police ready to respond to any incidents, and severe, draconian punishments for any violent crime. White collar crime is, comparatively, much more prevalent, but is punished just as severely by Mirania's institution and duty oriented culture. It's common for perpetrators of such crimes to never again find work on Mirania, and to be socially shunned by their peers. Mirania is rather hostile to non-humans. While not outright, aliens are commonly unwelcome from most social functions and workplaces, and some few have been the targets of violence. Apartment buildings that allow aliens, and office buildings that employ them, often have human-supremacist slogans painted on them, while the government, usually hard on such crime, seems less thorough and zealous when investigating these incidents.

## Restricted Information
Members of the new Miranian government might be privy to how truly institutionalised the anti-alien and anti-immigrant sentiment is, with widespread overlooking of discrimination in all regulatory levels of government that are meant to prevent such things. Mirania has also been remilitarising. The Bundeforz Difeza, once a token defence force for keeping away pirates, has expanded to include a small navy, and a well equipped army. It's rumoured among the citizens that the government may be planning on using these forces to press its claims on the neighbouring systems. However, information about these things is tightly controlled, and the government goes to great lengths to ensure it doesn't leave Miranian space.
