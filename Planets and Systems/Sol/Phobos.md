## History

Although the presence of Phobos has been known for centuries, with many drones and small manned expeditions being sent to it in the past, it wasn't until the late 24th century when this tiny moon was actually colonized. The reasons for this colonization to have occured so late were many, such as an initial lack of available funds to support a possible colonization project, along with an abnormally low gravity and moon size.

The initial purpose for Phobos would be the one of a penal colony, when governments from Earth and Mars realised that the presence of mineral wealth, proximity to Mars and it's tiny moon status would make for an acceptable place to gain a benefit at a criminal's expense. Criminals from mostly Earth and Mars would be sent over here to mine in a strict regime. For a few decades, this was the only activity performed on Phobos. Eventually, in the 25th century, some corporations realised that they could benefit from Phobos as well, deciding to start a small colonization drive for independent mining purposes that would offer any potential workers acceptable conditions.

Since Phobos is such a tiny moon that required a significant amount of space for mining and shuttle docking purposes, only a small section of it could have been colonized. The moon was decently settled on in a single location, where pretty much all of the settlers lived in. Obviously, the living conditions in said corporate-run settlement that was called Esteredge weren't as bad as in the penal colonies, as it had access to primitive yet effective gravity generators, along with decent water and food supplies. Many non-criminals from mainly Mars decided to try out their luck on Phobos, but it's to be noted that most criminals who finished serving their sentence at the Phobos penal colonies didn't have a place to go to after that, so they moved to Esteredge.

Said status was maintained for most of the 25th century. In the last part of the 25th century, most mineral deposits became less profitable due to a present overexploitation, although the activity still exists as of now. This required the economy of Phobos to be diversified somehow, and eventually the corporate-run settlement decided to give Phobos an acceptable stopping point function due to it's desirable location in the system and few docking difficulties.

In the 26th century, the correctional functions were already much lesser than in the past, although still present, which makes it keep it's penal colony status. It was then when Phobos was fully claimed by Sol Central due to the proven stability of Esteredge, the small corporate-run settlement being bought off as well. In 2559, Phobos hasn't suffered any noticeable changes, with temporary residents and immigrants arriving and long-time citizens leaving to try out their luck in other places as time passes.

## Politics

Phobos hasn't been able to obtain sovereignty due to it's tiny size and population, instead being now administered by Sol Central, entity which manages both the free settlement Esteredge and the remaining correctional facilities. However, due to it's close and strategic location to Mars, it hasn't turned into a neglected place as of now. Esteredge is managed by a central colonial administrator, while the correctional facilities and territories are managed by individual, auxiliary administrators. All of these are appointed by Sol Central, so democracy is unheard of here.

Although local law enforcement entities exist, Mars is in charge of any external defense, with many combat ships being permanently stationed at the shipyards of Phobos. It remains as a very protected place as far as colonies in the Sol system go, although high levels of crime are present in the free settlement areas, which causes a notable concern.

## Geography

Phobos is a tiny moon in a close orbit with Mars where most of it's space is used for correctional purposes or simply left unused. Terraforming is impossible on a place like this one, so Esteredge had to be built with domes, with the settlement expanding underground as well. Essentially, Esteredge is both a domed and underground city. It's slightly overcrowded with a population of approximately 18000 since expansions on the settlement have been rather slow lately. It is to be noted that Phobos is too small to be able to support a much larger population easily enough.

## Culture

Ethnically speaking, Phobos is a very diverse place, as it could be compared to the 21st century United States. Most of it's population consists of caucasian humans that still hail from many different places, although most of them originated from English-based cultures. As non-human races exist on this moon, most citizens have become aware of them, with many of the humans being xenophobic or cordial to them. Interhuman racism still exists here, so it's a very unpredictable place.

## Economy

The economy of Phobos is now more diversified than it was in the past. The service sector is going rather strong in Esteredge as lodging services exist due to the moon's strategic location, with notable trade being present as well, since two large and constantly busy space ports exist in the colony right now, with them being of an extremely high importance not for just Phobos, but for the entire solar system. It's a very connected moon, with many ships coming to and from the entire solar system and even other systems, in a considerably lesser degree. This stable intersystem connection has allowed alien races to gain a minuscule presence on the moon.

And of course, the mining sector is still present, but being now much less important than it was in the past. Underground farming is present as well, which is able to feed a good chunk of the moon's population while having to rely less on food imports. Several shipyards were built by Sol Central after the colonies' full acquisition as well, which gives Phobos a notable industrial power. Standard medical services are available in a decent degree, however due to the colonies' small size, post-obligatory education is completely unheard of, which requires any youngsters to leave the moon if they want to pursue more education.

Additionally, other more modernized sectors such as research, cloning or robotics are almost completely unheard of as well. No research institutions are present on Phobos, and no legal or authorized cloning facilities have ever been built on here. When it comes to the robotics sector, only small and independent workshops exist.
