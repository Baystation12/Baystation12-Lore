## History

With the first man stepping on Mars in 2052, it is the oldest terraformed colony in existence. Much of its early history was shaped by development, and war. The Colony Conflicts were led by the Ares Confederation, and there are still extremist factions on Mars that think Mars should be it’s own colony, rather than the Hub for the Federal Government.
Most of the History is easily accessible on the [[Humanity]](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Humanity) page. 

## Government and Politics

With the Capital of Sol Gov, Olympus, being situated on Mars, it's hard to find where Mars ends and Sol Gov Begins. To have an indepth guide to the inner workings of Sol Gov, Look [here](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/SCG/Sol-Gov)

The City States are often dominated by Oligarchic Leaders from the oldest, and wealthiest families, often with them having seats in an Assembly, or being a Director at one of the many Trans-Stellar Corporations with seats on Mars. 

City-States themselves make up so called Administrative Districts, which are controlled by the elected Governors and Small Assemblies. The Small Assemblies are representative bodies for the Districts that are "in charge" of handling the welfare of their district. There are 15 Major Districts, and in each district are numerous City States and countless Smaller communities.  Smaller communities have a very 21st Century American County feel to them, with local elected leaders for all parts of the community's administration.


### Defense and Law Enforcement

Mars is often considered one of the best places to live in Sol Gov, but that doesn't mean it's safe. Olympus itself is considered the safest place in the entirety of Sol Gov, but outside of Olympus, the local Police and Militia Forces handle most of the Security and Defense of their City States, or smaller communities. 

Once you get to the Lower Levels underneath the Cities, Crime ramps up. Police Forces are often less able or willing to go down 80 levels of tunnel systems and city-complex to deal with crimes, so they often go unhandled or forgotten. Violence, Racketeering, Drug Dealing and Organized Crime are the staples of the lowest levels, and their tendrils reach up as far as they can, some even tying onto the Oligarchs and Governors.

## Geography
* **Resources**: Silica and Ironoxide are the most abundant things you can find on mars, used primarily for making concrete and iron (which can then make steel). Aluminum is also heavy levels but not as much as Ironoxide. Otherwise, Mars is comparable to Earth in terms of resources, but lacks Oil and Coal.
* **Flora and Fauna**: All of the Flora and Fauna was imported from Earth over time. Wheat, Corn, Oak Trees, Wolves, and almost everything else you can think of was brought over to help feed the rapidly growing population, and create an ecosystem for new creatures to thrive in. The animals still around today are often referred to as a 'Martian X' such as the Martian Wolf, or the Martian Beetle. Most have acclimated to their new conditions and evolved in new and wonderous ways such as the butterflies. Martian Butterflies have grown larger in size, and many of those that use colors to camoflauge have changed from their ancestors' choices on Earth. Most flight animals and insects have gone this route, of growing larger. Most flora has grown larger too.

[Mars][2]

Mars has changed greatly since its days as Earth's Red Neighbor. The Snow-Capped Gideon Peaks that lie around the Tharsis Region reach high into the sky, separating not only Tharsis from the other regions, but dominate the other regions into a very tundra like biome. Olympus Mons still sits high above all others, but now with the cosmopolitan city of Olympus wrapped around and through it. The Delphi Mountain dominates most of the Northern coast, creating for wonderful seas of forest near the shore. Swamps and jungle fill the interior shores of the Continent, with great Savannahs to the south. Grazelands in the Hellenic Region around the massive Inner Sea have most of the remnants of the AgriDomes of old, now built into multilayered super-farms to feed the City States and smaller communities. Elysium Island to the North East on the map is a very mineral rich place, and the City States there show it with extravagance. 

Large, Boreal Forests with trees the size of the Ancient Earth Redwoods fill the South of the Continent, a great ocean of green foliage and wilderness doted with communities, and City States. 

The sands of the beaches and deserts still shine with their old, red color, and the sunsets glisten a crimson color. 

Development of the City-States and Communities has been mostly pre-planned, and with the addition of the UnderCities, most development hasn't had to sprawl across the land and cover all the wilderness. Most of the Ecosystems are protected habitats, with development of the towns being pushed upward or downward. 

### Climate

Climate varies from place to place, the northern parts of the Continent are generally warmer than the southerner due to their proximity to Equator of Mars, but temperatures are generally lower than those of Earth. The Dry and Wet Seasons dominate most of the Martian Landscape, unless you're in the Southeast or the Hellenic Region where there is a similarity to the old four seasons,

### Terrain

Most of the terrain is similar to Old Earth, but with different, striking colors and mineral make-ups. The Mountain Peaks are higher, and land is far more connected due to the singular continent. The great Northern Ocean covers around half the planet, with land over the rest of it. Olympus Mons stands high into the sky, with travellers being able to see it in the distance for miles and miles, as with some of the other peaks. Long mountain ranges like back on earth are nonexistant, but great craters and caverns dot most of the landscape, allowing for a wild landscape with cities built in and out of a tunnel on the surface. 


## Culture


### Ethnic Ties

There are hundreds of cultural groups across the surface of Mars but most of them can be defined into 10 Main Groups: Monsian, Tharseese, Delphin, Tunnelers, Hellshen, Charusian, Classical Aresian, Ascrasen, Gideons, and Elysian.

Each of these groups are either named for the Regions of the Continent they inhabit, or for their ancestors. Monsians are commonly from the Olympus Mons Regional area and Administrative District, and with it being the most populated region, they make up the largest above ground portion of the population. Tunnelers on the other hand, make up by far the largest part of the populace (as every City-State has a UnderCity). The next two largest groups are the Delphin and the Tharseese, named for the Tharsis Basin, a major economical and industrial heartland for Mars, and for the area around the peak of Delphi. Next are the Hellshen. The Hellshen are from the 11th District which covers the whole of the Hellenic Region, and contains the Hellenic Inner Sea. The Charusian, Ascrasen and Elysian are all named for the regions they come from. The Classical Aresians and the Gideons are those named for their ancestors. The Classical Aresians hold closely to their ancestors who controlled the Ares Confederation and are often highly supremacist and eugenic when it comes to "Breeding." Gideons are the smallest part of the demographic, made up of those who can trace their lineage to the earliest colonists on Mars. 

The Tunnelers are named as such for their life in the UnderCities. They're very pale in complexion, and bright blonde in hair. Vitamin D Shops are all over the UnderCities, and medicinal use of ultra-violet lights and special equipment to make sure Tunnelers are recieving the nutrients that they need are cheaper on Mars than anywhere else in Sol Gov. Tunnelers would be comparable to those who live in the big cities of the 21st Century in the ghettos, and crime-ridden neighborhoods (such as Harlem or Brooklyn in 70s-80s New York). They're a Hardy people, and don't like Offworlders, nor Aresians. 

The Monsians are most commonly found in Olympus and the other City States and Communities that make up District One. They're your average Martian, so to speak. They're a very open people, and generally make up the "Face" of Martian Society for Advertisements of the Planet. Aresians, Gideons and Hellshens are not fond of the Monsians due to their status on the planet. Most Oligarchs in the Northwest of the Continent are Monsians too.

The Delphin and the Tharseese are pretty much the same, the major difference being where they come from and their status. Tharseese are generally far richer than Delphins will ever be, with the Delphin City-states being run-down and not nearly as nice as the Tharseese. As well, the Tharseese are more used to the cold environment of the Tharsis Basin, with many of the Delphins living in the Humid Climate of Third District's North. They do not get along with eachother.  Delphins are also considered the most religious cultural group on Mars, with around 80% of all Delphins having ties to the Catholic Church. Most Muslims on Mars are also Tharseese. 

The Hellshens would be the Rednecks and Hillbillies of Mars. A culture of hard-working people who grew up in the Hellenic Region, living among HEB Mechs, AgriDomes, and super farms. Farming, Hunting and Agricultural Engineering are as common to the Hellshen as living in the UnderCities is for Tunnelers. They're a very secluded people, and often see the "Big Cities" people as vulgar and not "Martian Enough." They're primarily conservative, and religious, but not to the extent of the Delphins.

Charusians come from the Southwestern Charus Region and make up most of the Eigth and Ninth District. Both Districts are very rural in nature, and don't have plans to change. The Wildlife of Charus Region is it's primary attraction, as with the Hellenic Region but for different reasons. The Charus Region is primarily Boreal with Tundras to the far, far south, and most of the people here are secluded from eachother. The City States are very old and never really developed further, thus some still have the ancient Domes of Early Mars.

Ascraesens and Elysians couldn't be more different. Ascraesens live mostly in the high mountains of the Gideon Peaks, and are a very rough and tumble kind of people who don't take to outsiders kindly. Ethnic Cleansing has happened in the past against minorities who lived in the region that weren't predominately Ascraesens. Often they come into conflict with the Aresians and many minor conflicts have come and gone between the two groups. Elysians come from the large island in the Northwest of the Continent, and are generally known as the "Hippie Folk," for their free lifestyle. Most of the people there live in a very Communistic style, and don't often leave, but are very open to outsiders. The arts are more important to them than industry, and many of the greatest musicians and artists from Mars have come from Elysium. 

Classical Aresians are by far the most secluded demographic on Mars. They all live in the 12th District and outsiders are either blocked from living there, or disappear after moving. They're allowed to continue this way because of the powerful Oligarchs and their connections to the Solar Assembly. By many in Sol Gov they're considered a remnant of a War long past, and people who still won't forget the past.

Gideons are few and far between, but you know when you meet one. They're often thinner and taller than the average human, and most of them can't stop talking about how they're a Gideon. Gideons are those who can trace their heritage back to the first colonists to settle on Mars. With all records being kept, and parents already knowing if you're a Gideon or not, you pretty much go your entire life knowing that you are a descendant, and it often feels like Royalty. Gideons, in some City States, often have a celebrity status of a kind, and often get elected Governor of more minor cities (just as the Monsians in others) for the pure sake of being a Gideon. They are the only other cultural group on Mars that the Aresians accept with open arms due to their connection to the founding of the Red Planet. 

### Norms

Martians are now what Originals once were (Originals referring to those that came from Earth). They're varied in many ways, from the hard-working men and women that grow the crops of the Hellenic Region that feed the big-shots in Olympus, to the classical painters sitting idly on the shores of Elysium. The one thing they all have in common is Founding Day.

Founding Day is always on the 21st of March as that was the day James Archibald Gideon first stepped foot on the red sand, being the first Human to ever stand on another planet. Fireworks, Parades, Celebrations- a giant party to celebrate Martian Pride. Christmas is largely unpracticed on the planet but The Red Day, basically the first day of the new year for the Martian Calendar, is about the same thing but mixed with New Years. Most Martians use the Martian Calendar when on the planet, and switch to the Earth Calendar when they leave. 

In the Aresian City-States of Communities, Vorcha Day is celebrated. Vorcha Day takes place on the 18th day of the Martian Calendar, as that was January 2nd on Earth when the Vorcha Treaty was signed to end the Colony Conflicts. They celebrate to acknowledge those who died many, many years ago and to remember what Martians gave for the rest of the Colonists of Today. 

### Cuisine 

Martian food is pretty much the norm of what you might find out there with some exceptions for cultural tastes. Food's primarily based on old Earth cookings and recipes, and much of the same ingredients from then are around now, with the only difference being how they've strived on their new planet. The "Frouka" dish is a traditional cuisine from the early days of Mars that is still eaten today for the Red Day- Frouka is hard-boiled eggs that are fried and served with a spiced mustard paste and potatoes (the first food source to be grown on Mars). Hellenic Beer is known across Sol Gov for it's defined taste and is often considered one of the best if not the best alcoholic drinks produced by Humans. 


### Entertainment

Martians do what everyone else does. They're your average folk. 

## Economy
* **Imports**: Mars doesn't import much of anything besides common goods from other Sol colonies and computer system and ship parts from the refineries. If Mars was an independent colony it'd be 4th in line in terms of economic stability, just behind the Mirania Republic.
* **Exports**: Food, Silica, and Ironoxide are it's most common exports and usually to other Sol Locales without the ability to produce them. 

With the Economic Base of Sol Gov sitting in Olympus, it's safe to assume that Mars has the strongest Economy out of all of Sol Gov. Everything regarding Federal Trade comes through it's Hubs, and the trade the City States and Districts do keep the entire planet running like a well-oiled machine. If Mars were to collapse or go quiet, Sol Gov's Federal strength would fall through much in the same way the First Great Depression hit in the early 20th century.

## Science and Technology
Mars is the center of Sol Gov. Cutting edge tech isn't hard to find, but around 10-20% of it's population still lives in more rural communities and another 20-40% in suburban.

## Habitation
Mars has some of the best city planning of any colony in Human Space. The great cities on the surface are planned to the street corners, with some of the far older ones still having Domes over them, though most are inactive. The UnderCities support an entire second ecosystem of infrastructure that extends for many miles beneath the surface. The rural communities are their own beast entirely. Diversity of where you can live is plentiful on the Bastion of Sol.


## Notable Features

### The Monument

The Monument is a statue in a large field of tall, red grass in the Aresian Planes of the 14th District. The Monument is a giant slab of rock sticking out of the ground, and around is the graveyard of all the Martians who died in the Colony Conflicts, sprayed out across the land around the Monument, each one without a name. The slab itself details every single name of every soldier who died, and at it's base talks of what happened in the Wars, and what they accomplished. Many Aresians and Gideons take a Pilgrimage, of sorts, to The Monument every year on Vorcha Day. It's lit with red candles on Vorcha Day by people in the nearby towns. 

### Olympus

Built into, around, and on the plains surrounding the extinct supervolcano Olympus Mons, the city of Olympus was originally a research station, terraforming center, and spaceport. Due to its location, and relative lack of development, it was selected as the Capital for the Sol Central Government in the waning days of the Terran Commonwealth and built up into a massive diplomatic and governmental center. Both Assemblies are built into the volcano itself, along with the offices of many other organizations, the High Court, the Embassy Complex, and facilities for keeping the city running. Massive transit tunnels crisscross the mountain's interior, and its surroundings. Olympus has grown significantly out around the mountain, and onto the plains around it, though the highest density of government facilities remains in the volcano itself. The inside wall of the caldera is lined with landing pads and government apartments, and the very bottom of the caldera is home to a massive park, showcasing a unique ecosystem imported from Earth.

Olympus hosts the important Administrative buildings from the Diplomatic Offices to the Economic. Outside of it are various other settlements that dot Mars such as New Liberty, or Vorcia City.
