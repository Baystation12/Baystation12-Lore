# Mars
 
Mars is a hotbed of Politics in the 26th Century. On a grand scale, with it's capital exisiting on Olympus Mons, Sol Gov is the absolute controller of politics on Mars, but places like New Liberty and Vorcia City still have competing interests against that of the SCG, and the Black Flag Movement brings more violence and discourse to the Red Planet.

## History 

With the first human being standing on the Red Planet in 2052, to the nearly 7 billion people that live on it in the 26th Century, Mars has grown from humble beginnings, civil war, and colonial uprisings. The Historic Ares Confederation and their Civil War with the Terran Commonwealth brought about the power and strength of TSCs, and Mars was one of the first attempts by Humanity at terraforming a planet. Most of the events of the past are of public knowledge, or unimportant, but the major events related to [Humanity](https://baystation12.net/Humanity) can be found on The Timeline located on the linked page. 

### The Black Flag Movement

An anarchist movement that started in Maza, the BFM is a violent terrorist group that operates out of Maza City and Catti. It's goals are for the disestablishment of Sol Gov, and the return of an "Open Citizen" state, though their practices and ways to obtain this are conflicting. Using bombings, assassinations, and smallscale guerilla warfare, the BFM has brought a crisis of sorts to the seat of Sol Gov. 

There are rumors that New Liberty itself is backing the movement, but nothing is for certain.

## The Cities of Mars

With Mars having the capital of Sol Gov, it is safe to assume that it has a very centralized government, and a very high population, nearing the levels of Earth itself. These are the major cities, or megatropilses, that dot Mars, as well as the capital itself; Olympus.

### Olympus

Built into, around, and on the plains surrounding the extinct supervolcano Olympus Mons, the city of Olympus was originally a research station, terraforming center, and spaceport. Due to its location, and relative lack of development, it was selected as the Capital for the Sol Central Government in the waning days of the Terran Commonwealth and built up into a massive diplomatic and governmental center. Both Assemblies are built into the volcano itself, along with the offices of many other organizations, the High Court, the Embassy Complex, and facilities for keeping the city running. Massive transit tunnels crisscross the mountain's interior, and its surroundings. Olympus has grown significantly out around the mountain, and onto the plains around it, though the highest density of government facilities remains in the volcano itself. The inside wall of the caldera is lined with landing pads and government apartments, and the very bottom of the caldera is home to a massive park, showcasing a unique ecosystem imported from Earth.

Olympus hosts the important Administrative buildings from the Diplomatic Offices to the Economic. Outside of it are various other settlements that dot Mars such as New Liberty, or Vorcia City.



### New Liberty


The City-State of New Liberty was thought up in 2468 by Marcus Dentan, the Chief Operations Officer of GotoTech Industries, as a safe-haven of freedom, corporate work, commerce, and life. The idea was published in a magazine, with the name Corporate City given to it.

It wasn't until 2476, however, that the idea came up again and looked into by 3 organizations: Gilthari Exports, Astro Media-Journalism Corporation, and the main funding body, The Free Trade Union. Planning began when these 3 organizations began to work together to form the colony, and was thought out as a center of commerce, trade, information, news, and life.

Construction began in 2478 and ended in 2497.

New Liberty is run by companies. Originally headed by its 3 founders, today, the city has a body of 30 'Guilds' that vote in The Court of Regents.

Each member of the Court of Regents is a company or organization that has been bestowed the title of Guild by a minimum of 3 pre-existing guilds. Each Guild gets 3 Regents, chosen by any means the Guild wishes to use within themselves.

All Guilds' Regents work in this government institution; 99 Regents exist in all, with the original 3 founding companies having an extra 3 regents each. It serves as the colony's Legislative Branch, making laws, passing them, deciding budgets, regulations, and in rare cases, such as with Hesphaistos Industries, expel Guilds.

Regents are elected by this method: The Guild asks the people for a list of candidates they would like. The Guild can then choose to throw it out, or listen to it. (Usually, employees of the Guild are whom are asked.) The Guild then puts forth a list of Regent candidates to its employees living on the colony, who vote. The regents are then given power. The Regent must be living in or planning to live in New Liberty already.

The Magistrate of House is the colony's "Leader." They serve as both Executive and Judicial, the Senior Judge in the colony and the person in charge of enforcing laws and representing the colony in conferences and trade/business discussions. The Magistrate of House is elected by the Court of Regents from one of their own; they become Magistrate, and their Regency position vacated, to be filled by the company that the Regent comes from.


The city itself has four seperate space ports,one on each side of the city. Three of these are "Secondary" ports, existing almost soley for nearby industry and commercial needs to be handled. Each Secondary Port has three cargo ship docks and one passenger dock.

New Liberty's northern side has the Primary Space Port, a true hub. Modeled after twenty-first century airports, the Primary Space Port has 20 cargo ship docks and unloading areas and 10 passenger ship gates. The port has a refueling center, a series of resteraunts and bars,murals, and kiosk or many companies' goods.


The city also a number of rings for different purposes, such as seperating the infrastructure. The red ring focuses entirely on government and government relations. The House of Magistrate and Court of Regents are in this ring, as well as agency headquarters such as The Guard (the state police and military, seperated into two departments), the Sewage and Garbage Disposal Services, etc
This ring also houses 'Embassies'/Consolates from different unions and countries, though few of these buildings exist.

The yellow ring houses the city's commercial needs. Many businesses and company headquarters are here, due to the city's reputation, pro-commerce and pro-company regulations, near non-existant capital tax, and its ideal location on Mars.

THe blue ring houses all residential needs. Most buildings are multi-level apartments to save resiential space; however, some more expensive homes exist, usually owned by government members, company leaders, and people who rent them out. Near the ring gate facing The Primary Port, the residential area features mainly hotels and parks. Most of the Residential Ring is middle class, with some high class homes existing.

Outside of the residential ring is industry, the smallest ring. Industry is a minor, but necessary, need for a trade hub/economy center on Mars. This area features more than simple factories; manufacturing plants, canneries, butchery shops, etc. are here, on top of factories. However, due to strict regulations imposed on pollution by the Court of Regents, actual factories are limited. This is considered the colony's largest problem, but to many is seen as a way to prevent pollution.

Outermost is the city's walls/engineering center. All power generation, engineering staff, air purification, sewage treatment, garbage disposal, refuse management, etc. is handled here. This is where the colony handles its brute work. A large wall is also built here, massive and towering, a staggering 15 meters thick and 100 feet tall before it begins to slope. The wall was built to keep out raiders and outside danger, as well as help with atmospherics. Still maintained, Engineering is located mostly beneath the wall.


Finally the Agricultural Ring, designed by famous Hydroponic Master Steven Welwright, 4 massive biodomes exist outside the city wall. The purpose was to grow food and livestock to provide a self-sustaining food source to the city, as well as supply much Mars' food importation needs. Today, 3 1/2 of the biodomes function, with the South-Eastern one having suffered a malfunction ending in the destruction of the Biodome's right wing.

20% of the food, meat, milk, eggs, and other farmed goods here are exported outwards, to other colonies on Mars.

New Liberty has a strong economy, based on trade, distribution, hydroponics production, and outside tourism to the colony's massive Primary Space Port that to many is more mall than port.

New Liberty is in an interesting location; being on Mars,it would be an ideal stopping point to resupply on goods and sell merchandise coming from and going to Earth. However, New Liberty is also built on a higher plateau on Mars, giving it natural protection and closer (though minor) distance to the atmosphere's end.

On top of this, New Liberty was built where colonies exist, but no real way to trade existed. New Liberty prospers off of trading wth other colonies and traders, with company's often buying exotic goos that come in.

New Liberty also serves much of Mars' food problems. The four massive biodomes mass-produce fruits, vegetables, grain, dairy, and raises cattle, to supply the city using modern hydroponic systems similiar to trays onboard many stations, but on a much larger scale. Roughly 20% of what is produced is shipped off, sent to other colonies as imports to help earn capital and satisfy the planets importation needs.

The total population of the megatropolis is around 2.4 billion.

### Vorcia City 

The main urban deployment on Mars with a population of 2.2 billion inhabitants. It consists of 56 clustered domed cities, with 8 of them having an artificial gravity in it's majority. In total there are 134 registered municipalities, with 35 of them not having any dome coverage. 12% of the population live underground.

### Maza City

The second biggest urban development on Mars, with a population of 900 million inhabitants. It consists of 20 clustered domed cities, with 3 of them having an artificial gravity in it's majority. In total there are 67 registered municipalities, with 13 not having any dome coverage. 9% of the population live underground.



### Catti

Another base created by European and American governments in 2146, it’s known for being the most prosperous superpower-controlled domed city on Mars, with advanced gravity generators which made it comfortable for governments to make their embassies here, and for corporations to gain a solid presence. The mega-metropolis has a population of approximately 700 million.

### Trinta 

A base created by the Chinese government in 2158, this particular domed city is known for being near the coast of the Great Northern Ocean. It’s far more vegetation-based than the other major domed cities, and the outskirts are one of the greenest on Mars. This limits space for human population, however. The mega-metropolis has a population of approximately 600 million.

### Rinaii 

The last original colony of Mars, it was created by the Russian government in 2169, it’s the most farthest one when compared to the other ones. The mega-metropolis has a population of approximately 300 million.

### Conriston

About 550 square miles in size. Population of 32 million. Fully covered with a radiation-proof biodome. Independent atmospherics system. No gravity generators. Significant underground expansion, mostly from the early era. Part of the Vorcia City mega-metropolis. Area first settled in a large scale since 2360. Recognized as a Vorcia City municipality in 2373. Sealed off with a biodome in 2422. Territorial division in 2482. Same dome, but West Conriston is 290 square miles with a 14 million population. East Conriston is 260 square miles with 18 million pop. East Conriston tends to be fairly poorer than the westside.

### New Aaronshire

An open-air settlement 2700 kilometres away from the Vorcia City mega-metropolis, to the northeast. Population of 180000. Low degree of political and economic autonomy. Primarily founded as a mining community, with significant agricultural operations as of 2559. The settlement was first founded in 2392 and registered in 2401.

### Jamieson

Another open-air settlment, 300 kilometres from Conriston. Population of 90000, and a heavily agricultural community.
