## History

Pluto was first reached by Humanity during the exploration and expansion of the 23rd Century. For a quarter of the century, Pluto was at the top of the major mining corporations lists. It had rare minerals, ammonia, you name it. The grand mega structures that were built around it and the other surrounding asteroids helped fuel an industry, but a quick lived one at that. By the start of the 24th Century, most of the corporations had moved onto other interests as the resources under Pluto's surface were depleted. Work came and went for the colonists of the Dwarf Planet, mostly for salvage and deconstruction of the megastructures and drydocks so that their materials could be used on new locations. 

The planet would've been considered a 2nd world country by 21st century standards. High crime rates, low life expectancy and literacy rates, high health concerns, by all intents and purposes Pluto was the ugly child of Sol that everyone tried to forget and shove away. There is rumor, some hold to be true, that in this time period, the "Gutter" talk came into existence on Pluto. A weird mixture of slang, colloquial dialects, and old Earth languages spliced together with Common. 

Between the 26th Century and the general degradation of Pluto the in preceding centuries, not much occurred on the small world. Life got worse, crime rates rose, and the small world fell further and further into it's hole that was created by greedy corporations.

There was a revival effort in the 26th Century to update Pluto, give it a fresh coat of paint so to speak. Development projects, humanitarian aid, and all sorts of policing of the current cities were spread across Pluto in hopes to make it less of the ugly child and more acceptable to the Sol standard. To this day, most of the planet is still considered "under development." 


## Politics

Though a Democratic Republic, you could say that most of the colony is controlled by different criminal factions. Mostly any politician is in someone's pocket, and the largest political party, The New Right, are often noted as supporting the Confederacy of Man, and employing the Fury of Mankind. The Black Flag Movement on Mars has small footholds on the planet as well, as do other underworld organizations in the Sol System. There is a small Resomi Ghetto on the world near the center of New Santa Domingo that has often been threatened by these different groups. The High Secretary Marcus Rackham is considered a puppet by most for one criminal organization or another, but many agree that he is infact in the pocket of Grayson Manufacturing's CEO. 

## Geography

Pluto remains a dusty, icy ball on the outer edge of Sol. Flat, rolling plains, with some sparse, spiked peaks, and deep crevices. Craters cover some parts of the world, but it is mostly a desolate plain. The Heart, as it is called by those who pass the planet, is often a tourist attraction for people and aliens visiting the Sol System.

## Culture

Pluto doesn't have much of a culture besides an Honor Among Thieves. There are significant callings to Spain and Latin America from Earth in the older days of the planet, such as with New Santa Domingo. The Roman Catholic Church(???) has a heavy strength on the colony, as most of it's colonists follow the faith. New Santa Domingo is often called the Murder Capital of Sol, with it's high crime rates, and even higher yearly body count. The music genre known as The Reds came from the city, born out of the violence and corruption of the colony. The Black Market has a very strong presence on pluto as well, with almost anything passing through New Santa Domingo's underbelly. 
Though officially recognized as a terrorist organization, the Fury of Mankind can be seen throughout New Santa Domingo through posters, graffiti on buildings, or even those wearing the insignia on their clothing. The single Resomi Ghetto, often called, colloquially, "Resi ReonRedda" has been placed under Sol Gov security forces in recent months due to an increase of attacks on the Ghetto.

## Economy

Most of any economy on Pluto comes from the criminal underworld. Drugs, weapons, resources, ships, stolen goods, illegal cybernetics and augmentations, you name it, you can find it somewhere on Pluto. The only legitimate trades you can find often deal with manual labor, or police work, but no one wants to take the later, and there's barely any jobs left in the former. Unemployment rates on Pluto are extremely high. 

The cities are similar to the older Dome city ideas, with New Santa Domingo, the major city, made of many separate domes that take the shape of a cross on the planet's surface from a bird's eye view. The second major city, Borsai, is in more disrepair, with a completely unworking dome being part of the cities form. A hazardous place often the home of criminals of all kinds.
