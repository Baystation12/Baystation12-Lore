## History

Erebus is now the land of opportunities, with every slab of phoron shipped the rich get richer and the holes get deeper. Grayson Manufactories, seeing an increasing need for mining, processing, and transportation related technologies, decided to set up shop on the moon of Casser. Most companies went for the other, nearby moons on account of the rich phoron veins. While Casser has much iron and platinum, its phoron veins are short and rare, making it one of the less desirable of the countless moons. GM saw this as an opportunity, using their experience in both mining and industry, they set up a small but efficient mining outfit that quickly became one of the main exporters of Erebus, almost single-handedly manufacturing all of the equipment used on Erebus's moons.

The small mining platform turned into a huge operation with refineries and factories covering the majority of the moon's surface. The only 'true' city on the moon surrounds the largest space port, where all of the manufactured goods are transported off of the moon and resources from other nearby moons are transported.

## Politics

While the majority of the actual work is done by independent companies and contractors, GM has kept them all under its thumb through control of growth and transportation. Very carefully, they have made sure none of the companies doing the mining or working the factories is big enough to shove their own weight around and uses the looming threat of spaceport access to make sure they don't expand too rapidly.

## Geography

Casser is a medium sized moon with one of the largest orbit radius's of all the moons of Erebus. Its southern 'pole' (relatively) has been hollowed out by the mining operations, with a nearly 5 mile long diameter and over 50 miles deep and been given the local name of "The Pit". The rest of the moon is covered in various refineries, transport trains, and factories. On the north pole is the biggest space port (Called Central Spaceport), with two smaller space ports aligned to the west and east.

## Culture

There are two main 'cultures': for the people who mine, life is all about getting payed and finding things to do when they aren't working. They see themselves as honest people, who get what they deserve (and maybe deserve a little bit more!) and keep to themselves.

Finally, the surface culture is very corporate. Its all about whose on top, and how to get there. Everyone dreams of working for GM, or at the space port.

## Economy

GM has made a lot of money off of Casser! The people? Not so much. The miners make enough to live, but barely. The factory workers make a little bit more, and the corporate representatives make a decent day's wage.
