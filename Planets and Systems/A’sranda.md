## History
* **Discovered**: 2440
* **Founded**: 2442
First discovered in 2440 past the edge of Republic space by scouts who were charting unknown territory. The world was found to have an exceptionally strong magnetic field, aside the fact that it was covered almost entirely by mountainous continents, hardy vegetation, and other hardy creatures that lived both on land and in the large bodies of water that take up the surface of the world. Almost all of this data had to be recovered on the surface of the planet due to the interference caused by the planet’s strong magnetic field. The planet was otherwise noted for having a high content of industrial materials that were entirely unexploited. This led to a relatively quick attempt to found a colony on the alpine world.
