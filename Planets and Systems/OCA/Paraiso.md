## History

The closest habitable planet to the Orion Ceta Gateway that was established in 2491, it's natural beauty and other desirable planetary conditions were quickly noticed by Gilthari Exports, which established a small colony in 2497. Rather than overly populating or industrializing this planet, it was intended to be a corporate tourist resort.

With no other claims from other entities on this planet, drastic measures to preserve the natural scenery were taken. Industry and logging were able to be outlawed as soon as 2499, and hunting activity was limited to an extent by giving many native species protected status, and heavy fees would need to be paid in order to gain permission to hunt the rest.

Carnelia has remained as a popular tourist resort for decades, as this type of scenery is now rarely seen on other terrestrial planets in human space. It's known for it's almost complete lack of pollution and untouched beaches, jungles, oceans and mountains.

In 2559, Gilthari Exports still controls the entire planet. While the average person would probably have it hard to be able to afford a vacation here, it still remains as one of the most famous and luxury tourist resorts in the entire known galaxy.

## Politics

Due to it's small populace and the nature of the system, the colony is exclusively in corporate hands, which governs the people after their image. Administrators are appointed to Carnelia, who run the place to ensure the most profit after the guidelines given from Gilthari Exports.

Security staff handle on planet crimes and enforce the restrictive rules of the place, such as forbidding pollution, careless trash throw-away and logging. Without fees paid, tourists and scientists are not allowed to take any kind of biological or mineral wealth with them. The local fauna and flora is to be protected.

The orbit of the planet is heavily secured by Gilthari security vessels who are active near the Orion Ceta Gateway, which makes criminal intrusions fairly rare.

## Geography

Carnelia is a so called paradise world, a terrestrial planet with a diameter of 6500 km, with a tremendous biosphere and fertile landscape. 90% of the planet is covered with water, with the landmass mainly composed of islands and small continents. The largest continent, where also the spaceport is located is Paraiso a Astrés. Almost all of the planet is covered with jungle, with few islands sporting mountains of a volcanic origin, the biggest being Mount Malona, where a small observatory is established.

Many tourists and permanent settlers comment how peaceful the planet is. And indeed, many exotic animals lurking on the wild planet are not very aggressive or fear humans. Paraiso birds and reptiles are a popular pet for wealthy circles.

## Economy

As a tourist resort, the economy of Carnelia is obviously almost exclusively based on tourism. Most food is either imported from off-planet or harvested from the tropical trees in the region. There is also small-scale hydroponics and fishing activity present here.

Xenobiologists, xenobotanists and hunters were always interested in the fauna and vegetation of this planet. While they don't tend to get full operation rights in Carnelia due to heavy corporate regulations, they are sometimes allowed to stay in here for long periods of time, if fees are paid. This is yet another source of income for Gilthari.

In general, the colony is extremely profitable for Gilthari. Maintenance costs are very low due to the lack of heavy industry or infrastructure present, and said costs are reduced even further as the corporation often hires cheap non-human labourers such as Unathi security guards or Tajaran service personnel.
