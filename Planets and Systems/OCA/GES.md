### History

The NES Sycophant was originally a [Sol Central][1] station created alongside the Orion Ceta [gateway][2] in the year 2491. Back then, called Sol Central Outpost Orion Ceta, it was created by autonomous systems and were used as a fueling station, survey control and communication hub for the Orion Ceta sector. Housing only roughly fifty expedition members, the craft was a small satellite around Carnelia, a highly specialized body for temporary housing and coordination efforts.

2493, after the sector was completely mapped out, the first permanent colonization efforts began, first on Elestus II by Joffrey Smallwaters. After the apparent success of this colony into establishing a functioning society, [TSCs][3] took interest into the sector, first of all [Gilthari Exports][4], who quickly bought out Sol Central and renamed the station GES Sycophant.

2495, the station was expanded drastically, allowing colonists and Gilthari functionaries to permanently settle in the station and coordinate their efforts from there. Using the old station as core, survey control and fueling apparatus were gutted out and several sections built onto the station. Success was made with Carnelia's tourism resort, which led to another surge of expansion.

After being officially recognized as human sector and under the governance of the Sol Central Government, in 2500 a Sol Court was established for the Orion Ceta Sector. With the station being well-established, it was designated as the residence for the judge, leading to the biggest expansion of the station.

Over the decades, the GES Sycophant was constantly being expanded and is the biggest station of the Orion Ceta sector, housing numerous facilities and being the beacon of civilization in this frontier. House of the Sol Court for this sector, as well being a fuel station and shipyard for Sol Gov law enforcement vessel, the Sycophant also functions as major trade hub and telecommunications beacon for the systems of Orion Ceta, with almost 1300 people using it as a permanent residence for their operations.

### Politics

The station is administrated by Admiral Esteban De Losa and his command staff, including a chief engineer, a foreman in spacer construction and the head of security, as well a human resources department.

While corporate security is on side, Sol Central is the primary law enforcement of the station, with caught criminals put into the sector court and a Sol Central owned prison wing.

### Economy

There is not much dedicated industry at all on the Sycophant and no mining operations. Needed materials and manpower are imported and contracted with the help of other TSCs. The main focus of the station lies within the entertainment and housing sector. Many a bar and discos are found here, as well hotels and even apartments for renting, serving as a resting spot for travellers.

Another function is that of a trade hub and exports and imports from and to the Orion Ceta sector find their way almost always to the Sycophant first. Coming with that, it is also the seat of the local law enforcement of SolGov and their Sol Court for this sector. The hub is also used for colonists for their last stop before they meet their settling location.

The last and mayhaps most important factor of the Sycophant are telecommunications services. Bluespace radio hubs are using the Sycophant as beacon and the station controls and guides spacer traffic.
