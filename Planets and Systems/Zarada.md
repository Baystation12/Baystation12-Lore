## History
Tetrad-8 was originally discovered by a survey team working under the Terran Commonwealth in 2365. Being such a dangerous planet, no one was initially willing to colonize it because it seemed too much trouble than it was worth. The Commonwealth continued to attempt to pawn off the territory to willing groups for a decade.
After much consideration, thought, and study, West African scientists found opportunity in the potential for colonizing Tetrad-8. Under the pretense of establishing a power plant on Tetrad, West African nations such as Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, Benin, and others formed a coalition. The Commonwealth graciously granted the territory to this group, now known as the Zarada Coalition. In the year 2376, they started constructing a fleet. By 2384, the fleet was launched.
Upon arrival on Tetrad in May of 2386, Zarada faced many problems with initial establishment. Originally, they had to create satellites around Tetrad where they would live. The surface was extremely hot, and they did not have the equipment to send down permanent buildings.
After a year, they finally had built or imported enough equipment to finally send an establishment team to the surface. They did so, and while they had much difficulty sending it down, they were able to create several permanent buildings on the planet's surface with only two fatalities. In honor of the establishment, they named this small set of buildings 'Zarada Power Plant' in August 2387.
Almost immediately, teams began collecting geothermal power from the crust of Tetrad. Even though they had such a small establishment, they soon had more power than they knew what to do with. Zarada began to store that power in the satellites surrounding it and sell the power to any passing ships. With the funds from this, Zarada was able to continue paying for more equipment for buildings on the surface. Zarada continued to expand terrestrially and extraterrestrially via satellites.  In March of 2388, a survey crew discovered residue of supermatter crystals.  After further study, they found that there was a massive deposit there.  Mining began immediately.  More and more supermatter deposits were quickly found and mined.
The provisional government was replaced for a more permanent Republic in 2390. The government initially worked very inefficiently due to communication concerns between the surface and the satellite establishment. This was fixed when the Orun-Ila was completed in 2401. The Orun-Ila is the 'Sky-Line', a space elevator connecting the satellites of Zarada and the on-ground outpost. With the Orun-Ila, the colony thrived and continued to expand its mining industry as well as a decent hydroponics industry in the satellites, but that is mainly for self-sufficiency.
As the years went by, things continued to expand. Zarada grew and prospered as a supermatter exporter as well as a 'refueling station' for passing ships. Many freighters viewed it as a sort of 'freight stop' where they could stay for a few days and unwind.
In the 2440s, there was a housing crisis on Zarada as the populace was reproducing faster than they could make houses. This resulted in an increased effort to create homes. This worked initially, but people did not foresee that in the 2480s these houses' life support systems would fail due to sloppy production. Since then, policies have been pushed that keep housing standards on the surface of Tetrad very high, but that does not fix the thousands who lost their lives.
With the advent of Human shield technology after meeting the Skrell, all buildings on Tetrad were given heat shield technology as a precaution. Laws were passed that require this on all buildings. These shields mainly exist as a cautionary measure and so that the outer plating of buildings does not need to be replaced so much; the buildings can survive on their own in the event of a power surge or something similar that brings down the shield.
While in recent years, the popularity of Zarada has dropped as a freight stop and they are somewhat stagnating, the population keeps growing at an alarming rate. Due to this, housing is constantly pumped out. Newer generations of Zaradi fear that they will soon become irrelevant as a hotbed for supermatter and as a freight stop. 

## Government and Politics
Zaradi are very proud of their governmental system as it remains a direct democracy, with all elected officials being direct majority voted in. Different districts of the population are divided based on population density, although population density remains relatively consistent on the surface of Tetrad at least.
District Officials are voted in for every district and they vote on laws. The president ensures that they remain on the right track and passes executive decisions. District Officials can choose to have their district vote on laws that are proposed. They usually only do this for larger laws that directly affect the populace of their district. However, some Officials make it part of their campaign that they will not allow their citizens to vote, as they layman does not understand politics. Those Officials tend to not get voted in.

### Foreign Relations
Zarada is part of SolGov. Zaradi tend to have a distaste for the Terran Confederacy, and are not on very good terms with many of its memberstates. While Unathi are one of the largest non-Human populations on Zarada, they are extremely marginalized on Zarada along with Tajara. There have been cases of hate crime on Zarada against Tajara or Unathi. As a result, Zarada remains on shaky grounds with Unathi and Tajaran governments. Skrell appreciate Zarada for the supermatter they export to them as well as some developments in heat shield tech that they have shared with them.
### Defense and Law Enforcement
Zarada has a small military force that works mainly just to defend the satellites. They patrol the planet and ensure that there are no threats approaching.
The Zaradi Police Force is a very active unit of paramilitary police members both stationed on the surface and on satellites. They keep the peace.

## Geography
* **Resources**: Tetrad has an abundance of three things: supermatter ore, heat, and sunlight.
* **Flora and Fauna**: None.

The surface of Tetrad is of dark, hard soil. It is relatively mountainous. Buildings on the surface are very close together, and there are a lot of them. Satellites are relatively the same as the buildings on the surface, but they require less life support systems.

### Climate
There is really not much to say about Tetrad's climate. It is extremely hot all of the time, and there are next to no observable differences in seasons. It tends to be hotter along the equatorial line.

## Culture
Over the years, West African tradition has remained very prominent in Zarada. Many of the traditions prominent around the Nigerian tribes have molded together into one Zaradi culture. Zaradi are very proud of their identity as both Human and Zaradi.
Zaradi, being very proud of their history and traditions, have oral storytellers called griots.  These storytellers typically function as teachers or professors in Zaradi society.  The stories they tell are usually of great events, a particularly favored one of the griots is the story of how Zarada came to be.  These stories typically are very elaborate and expressive, having a moral behind every one of them.  It is not uncommon that these stories will have a musical element behind them.  Given that holograms now allow people to see entire performances such as that of a griot in three dimensions, the overall per capita amount of griots has been steadily declining.  However, Zaradi still love griots and have them work as teachers and perform at weddings and other important ceremonies.  Many of the older generations of Zaradi view it as a tragedy that oral tradition seems to have taken the backburner in recent decades.
Music on Zarada is known for its heavy beats and use of synths.  Reminiscent of Afrobeat, most of the music with lyrics includes chanted vocals, usually in traditional West African languages.  Synth-Mbalax is a new twist on an old West African form of music heavily reminiscent on rock.  This genre tends to be bass guitar, synth, and drum heavy and almost always contains some form of singing.  It is a very loud form of music, but the synths tend to make it flow very well and quite beautiful in its own way.  This form of music tends to be played at Zaradi nightclubs and weddings.  One relatively popular Synth-Mbalax artist is known as Itunu.  She was made popular by her album 'The Bird and the Stone'.
Zaradi clothing is very bright and vibrant.  Most of the clothing worn there has a meaning attached to it, typically portrayed with both the designs on the clothing and the colors on it, each color associated with a different idea or feeling.  Embroidary is a very common artform with Zaradi as they use their designs to both create beautiful clothes as well as engaging stories, usually told by the artist or a girot.  Clothing on Zaradi also tends to be thick and durable as a consequence of them living in such dangerous conditions.
Meals tend to be very minimalist for Zaradi.  As a result of them not being able to produce enough food to sustain themselves, Zaradi have been culturally forced to eat just enough so that they do not use up all of the food that they import.  That, however, does not mean that they are starving by any means, as the average Zaradi is very healthy.  Regardless, food tends to be very spice-heavy and minimalist in regards to meat, with high emphasis on starches and grains.  Eating meals is viewed as a very social thing for Zaradi, extended families will usually have one large meal together weekly if not daily.
Family is very important to Zaradi.  Extended families live in close proximity to each other.  There is a very high emphasis on males finding a wife and having children.  Some males are frustrated with this, especially nonheterosexual males, and they move away.  There is a disparity of males to females on Zarada because many males move away or become freight pilots when they come of age.  However, the population continues to grow.

### Entertainment
Most people regard Zarada as very boring. However, there are many night life facilities on the satellites. These were created for freighters who would stop at Zarada for days on end to unwind. Zaradi frequent these as well. Besides that, Zaradi are well known for their love of music.

## Economy
* **Imports**: Zarada imports just about everything besides power.
* **Exports**: Zarada exports mainly unrefined supermatter crystals.  They do occasionally export power because of their massive excess of it, but for the most part, their power is either used up on the surface, or sold to passing ships.

Most of Zarada's money is made from their industry surrounding supermatter crystals. Zarada does boast many power stations on their satellites that allow them to sell power to ships.  This has led to them becoming the freight stop that they are today. Their economy isn't currently on the rise. It is stagnating, but the populace remains at a relatively middle level of income.

## Science and Technology
Zarada is about on the same level as most other societies technologically. Transportation tends to be via tubes. Buildings are so close together that there is really no way of owning a personal vehicle, so everyone gets around via walking or public transport. The ?run-Ila is used by thousands daily for commutes and the like. Given that mining is a very central part of their society, they also have quite advanced mining technology and equipment, and have made some breakthroughs in mineral scanning.  Power collection and storage technology is absolutely stellar on Zarada. They have made several innovations on that as well as heat shield improvements that they were able to give to the Skrell.
Due to their excess of power, Zarada constantly engages itself in scientific projects that involve massive amounts of power, be it shield generation, matter replication, or laser technology.  Overall, there is a relatively large scientific field in Zarada.

## Habitation
Surface buildings are very cramped and closely packed together. They require massive amounts of life support and hull shielding. Waste systems do their best to recycle all human waste for farming.
Satellite buildings are pretty standard. They tend to have a lot more solar panels than standard.

## Hazards and Crime
The surface of Tetrad is extremely hot. A person who stepped outside in a normal softsuit would turn to ash in seconds.
There is a relatively high hate crime rate against Unathi and Tajara. Authorities are working to counteract this.
