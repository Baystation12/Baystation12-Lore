## History

Ceres station was originally set up for mining, in early 2284. It was expanded for habitation, and eventually large districts and areas were formed. The population and districts were connected via the Ceres Pod Tram system.
The Medina district was eventually expanded to include a large marketplace area. At this point Ceres had several thousand permanent citizens, some not even working in the mines.

During 2311, The population was straining the infrastructure of Ceres station, and many districts were overpopulated, which led to a rise in violent crime, parts of the infrastructure was damaged and rampant crime took over much of the station. Eventually in late 2311, The infrastructure was repaired and upgraded, with an extra extension for the Medina and Derve districts for housing.

Ceres station has recently become less and less of a mining colony, and more and more a cultural mix and housing area. Violent crime rates had dropped dramatically, between 2311 and 2500, With the addition of several more districts. However the unemployment of Ceres was quite an issue, with very little work other than maintenance and supply at the docks, however an emerging cultural trend became extremely strange and complex engineering. Much of the population of Ceres became structural, maintenance, and electrical technicians, working to make sure the air stayed in and the water didn't flood. Although there was still many unemployed.

Then during Mid-2513, the entire asteroid was purchased from by Falco Designs, as Sol Gov did not need Ceres Station any longer. Sol Gov remained the police force there, however everything else was owned by Falco. In three years, Falco designs built an entire extended shipyard, with the capability to manufacture thousands of ships, and feed the interstellar market's demand for luxury spaceships. Ceres' mass unemployment and low economic value came to an end, when Falco designs provided jobs for almost the entirety of Ceres' unemployed peoples.

Now, Ceres station is commonly a stop for passing by trading ships, and a home for thousands, a multicultural mix of everything imaginable and the manufacturing home of the galaxy's finest spacecraft.

## Politics

Ceres station is controlled by Falco Designs, who own the asteroid after purchasing it from Sol Central, all of the essential systems are maintained by Falco Designs' hired engineers, while some, more non-essential systems are subcontracted.The only Sol Central presence on the asteroid is a police force to keep law and order.

## Geography

Ceres station has a self contained atmosphere and goes deep into the surface of Ceres, Areas are divided into districts, and categorized. Mining areas are less travelled, and official restricted areas like engineering and water pump stations. Many lower class districts are overcrowded and difficult to walk through. The Medina district is full of apartments, and a large marketplace area, where private businesses thrive. Much of the Constructed Ceres area is actually infrastructure, piping and electronic equipment.

A large section of the station, the shipyard, was built in 2516, by Falco Designs, built as the first, and primary manufacturing centre of Falco Design's spacecraft, and the drydocks of the shipyard, taking up most of the exterior view of the stations. Due to these large obstructions outside the station, all traffic entering and exiting Ceres is directed by landing lights and beacons.

## Culture

The culture of Ceres is composed of many, many old earth cultures, combined and modified to form what is commonly referred to as "Belter"culture. Sports are composed of Zero gravity versions of sports from earth. Belter culture has recently begun merging alien cultures.

Many belters speak Old Earth Cantonese, and Sol common, because of their ancestors being of that heritage, and the languages radiated through the culture. Belters are highly exclusionary of pure bred humans born on Earth, and Mars.

## Economy

Ceres station does mining, however mining operations have stalled due to most of the useful mineral deposits having been harvested. Ceres' lower class citizens spend much of their time in the Medina district for the market. A lot of thriving private businesses can be found there. The official currency is Thaler. Quite recently, A small business on Ceres has been artistic engraving, where amateur and talented artist alike, make engravings in rocks or minerals. The minerals are quite often native to Ceres, but do not have much monetary value, with much sitting in storage.

Ceres primary income stream is Falco Designs' ship building. Providing many jobs for many native belters, and giving well made, high quality ships to the rest of the world. Falco Designs has a monopoly of the luxury ship market, which gave a monumental boost to Ceres' stock value, as money flowed in from Falco designs to improve the shipyards tooling, working conditions, and extra docks for spacecraft construction.

Ceres' economy is seeing an upturn, from a very long downturn, as Falco Designs rescues the economy of Ceres, flowing money in.
