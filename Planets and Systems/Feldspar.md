## History

KPE-5 was selected for colonization after a survey performed by a SolGov probe identified it's habitability, along with it's deposits of Titanium and Silicon. The colonization was organized and funded by SolGov, and sponsored by Grayson Manufactories Ltd, who provided a large amount of funding and expertise for the initial colonization. Feldspar was founded in 2478, and slowly grew to the modest colony it is today. Due to KPE-5's distance from Sol, the initial colonization group, as well as the support ships that followed, provided a relatively small population. In order to increase production despite having such a small labor force, large amounts of automated mining and agriculture machines were constructed, allowing the small population to multiply their labor and create an economy that eventually attracted more colonists, as well as other corporations. The colony was named Feldspar because it was established near a mountain range that, from a distance, resembled a Feldspar formation.

## Politics

Feldspar is a young colony, and so it's government is limited to a democracy in which settlements elect their own leaders, who then administrate the settlements as a group. Colonists are given access to free health care and subsidized food and energy. Due to KPE-1491's distance from Sol, there is a lack of other options for colonists to seek, and Feldspar's economy is far less capitalistic than worlds closer to Sol.

## Geography

KPE-5 is a garden world with temperatures ranging from 58' Fahrenheit during it's summers, and -20' Fahrenheit during it's winters. It's atmosphere is relatively close to Earth's, and has been adjusted to be even closer to Earth's due to terraforming done after it was first colonized. KPE-5 is highly mountainous, with multiple continents separated from each other by brackish seas. The native plant life is limited to rudimentary phototrophs, with primitive algaes thriving in it's seas. Very basic animal life has evolved from it's sea life, which resembles Earth's insect life in appearance. Most of KPE-5's animal life employs a symbiotic relationship with specialized algaes, which have evolved to utilize photosynthesis to generate energy, and excrete nutrients that are used by the creatures it grows on. In return, the animals provide a method of movement for the algae to spread and reproduce in the oceans. As KPE-5's animal life evolved to live on land, the algae itself evolved in to a more moss like organism, forming colonies itself on the skins of the animals.

## Culture

The colonists of Feldspar enjoy a culture mainly based around the European cultures from Earth, with necessary changes to suit their environment. Sports are popular, with Soccer being the favourite among it's citizens. The citizens of Feldspar and the other settlements enjoy a variety of pass times and recreational activities, with nothing standing out among them.

## Economy

Most of Feldspar's economy is based upon agriculture and mineral extraction. KPE-5 has a large percentage of Titanium with a significant amount of Silicon within it's crust, making it's mountainous regions a desirable location for mineral extraction. KPE-5 has a young, verdant biosphere which, after some modification of both native and Earth flora and fauna, has produced desirable conditions for growing bulk amounts of crops, such as Wheat, Barley, and Cotton. As such, Feldspar has a well developed alcohol and textile economy as well. A majority of the labour performed on KPE-5 is done by large numbers of automated machinery, controlled by low intelligence AI's which manage the day to day operations, as well as coordinate with colonial leaders to plan long term goals and objectives. This has made a career in robotics an ideal choice for it's citizens, and it has also attracted many robotics specialists to the planet.
