## History
* **Discovered**: 2472
* **Founded**: 2473
The founder of Saveel was a merchant of Sirisai; their name lost to time but likened to: Deliverer. They are seen as almost a prophet that lead the Sav to their holy-land. The Deliverer stumbled upon Zer’een during the year of 2472. Their ship’s engine had a malfunction that caused an emergency landing, The crew came across an undocumented world full of long snowy plains teeming with wildlife. The crew set up a brief shelter while their engine was to be repaired. After a weeks time the Deliverer marked the coordinates on his map and set off to Sirisai when the engine was fully repaired. 
On Sirisai they began to recruit; a secretive group formed in their midsts. A group of people looking for a collective home that was mostly comprised of young Resomi aging 14-20 who wanted to make a name for themselves. The year of 2473 is when the Deliverer returned to Zer’een. The Deliverer took their people, totaling 34, back to Zer’een with primitive weapons such as simple laser rifles and stun-spears. General weaponsmiths were brought to Zer’een so that if anything were to break it could be repaired as fast as possible with minimal contact to the outside world. Simple generators were taken to bear the stress of supplying electricity to the colony. 
The shelter made a year prior was still standing and eventually became their Town Hall (Still the Town Hall to this day). Crude buildings made of hardwood were propped up close to the center. At first the Sav hunted for their foods until a month after their arrival the first farm was created. The farmers raised and slaughtered the wildlife, that resembled cows, and kept the colony fed. The Deliverer completely cut off contact with Sirsai and had the ship that brought them there dismantled. The Deliverer was the defacto leader of the early colony.  After the Deliverer passed away the eldest Sav stepped up in their place. The second leader of Saveel, known as The Heir, is referred to in religious texts as a devout disciple of the Deliverer. The Heir set up the Council of Elders to guide him in his ways which became a tradition within Sav politics and is still used to this day. History and religion is regulated by the current leader; they choose what to teach as well as how to teach it.
