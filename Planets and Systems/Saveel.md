## History
* **Discovered**: 2472
* **Founded**: 2473
The founder of Saveel was a merchant of Sirisai; their name is now lost to time replaced by the title: Deliverer. They are seen as almost a prophet that lead the Sav to their holy-land. The Deliverer stumbled upon Zer’een during the year 2472. Their ship’s engine had malfunctioned, causing an emergency landing. Stumbling out of their damaged vessel, the crew found an undiscovered world, blanketed in snow, and teeming with wildlife. The crew set up a brief shelter while their engine was repaired, and spent that time watching, and learning about the new planet. After a week's time, and with the engines repaired, the Deliverer marked the coordinates on his map and returned to Sirisai.

On Sirisai the deliverer began to recruit; they formed a secret group, unbeknownst to the Republic. A group of people assembled, some looking for a new home, some looking for adventure, and some just wanting to make a name for themselves. Most of the first colonists were young, Resomii of ages between 14 and 20, and were prepared to leave everything behind. The Deliverer promised a simpler life, free from the gluttony of the Republic, and many listened. In 2473 the Deliverer gathered up their flock and returned to Zer’een, still unknown and unrecorded by the Republic. Numbering 34, the Deliverer and his followers brought only simple technology and primitive weapons, such as basic laser rifles and stun-spears. Some of the colonists were mechanics and engineers, to ensure that if anything were to break it could be repaired as quickly as possible with minimal supplies from the outside. 

The shelter made a year prior after the crash was still standing, and was quickly adapted to fit the needs of the new community. Eventually it became their Town Hall, and remains standing today. Crude buildings made of wood were erected around the shelter, creating the foundations of a simple village. At first the Saveelian hunted for their food, until the first farm bore fruit, or at least fungus, about a month after Landing Day. The farmers raised and slaughtered wildlife, and the colony grew. After collecting another flock of 21, the Deliverer had the ship that brought them there dismantled. Without any communications or record of Zer'een, the Republic would never know of Saveel's founding, or its survival. The Deliverer was the undisputed leader of the early colony, and was respected with an almost religious reverence.  The Deliverer passed away in 2482, and was buried under a cairn in the center of town, whereupon the eldest Sav stepped up in their place. That second leader of Saveel, now known as The Heir, is referred to in religious texts as a devout disciple of the Deliverer. The Heir established the Council of Elders to advise him, and help guide the colony, which it still does today. In time, the role of leader solidified into the office of High Priest, who speaks the word of God and the Deliverer.

The colony persisted like this for almost a century, unaware of the chaos that had wracked the Resomi society they had left behind. In time, tales of the homeworld and the technology there attained almost mythical qualities. The village grew into a town, and as older technology failed, simpler technology became more common. Resomii often traveled a ways from the colony, forming small hunting camps or religious retreats, but tended not to stray too far south so as to avoid warmer climates. Generations were born and died alone, until 2551.

A survey ship, owned by Grayson Manufactories entered Re'eshi on a routine mineral exploration mission. Suitably far away from SolGov, the captain was no doubt hoping to find valuable minerals close enough to Ahdomai to utilize some Tajara labor. After a number of uninteresting gas giants towards the outer edge of the system, the ship ran a survey of the inner planet, unbeknownst to them, Zer'een. After basic scans, the vessel found few interesting minerals, but were surprised to detect artificial light towards the pole of the southern hemisphere. A closer examination revealed a small tribal society. Intending to reap the rewards of first contact, the captain of the vessel landed and approached the village. Fortunately for him, his crew included a Resomi mining engineer, a refugee that had been hired by Grayson for being a mineral specialist; if that Resomi had not been present, it's likely the Grayson crewmen would have been killed or eaten when they were surrounded by a Saveelian hunting party. Facilitating communication, the Grayson Resomi was able to avoid an incident, and though the Saveelians were no new species, the Grayson captain  was able to negotiate with the Head Priest. 

Against the recommendations of the Council of Elders, the tribe would trade with Grayson in order to acquire supplies and replacement parts for the village's ancient generators. While it is currently forbidden for Saveelians to leave the colony, an infrequent trade with outsiders has continued, exchanging trinkets and exotic foodstuffs for basic technology and raw materials. In 2559, anthropologists were permitted to live in and study the village, where they continue to learn more about Saveelian culture and history.
