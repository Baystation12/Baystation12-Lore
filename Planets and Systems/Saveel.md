## History
* **Discovered**: 2472
* **Founded**: 2473

The founder of Saveel was a merchant of Sirisai; their name is now lost to time replaced by the title: Deliverer, or in Schechi, Riki'kiaka. They are seen as almost a prophet that lead the Sav to their holy-land. The Deliverer stumbled upon Zer’een during the year 2472. Their ship’s engine had malfunctioned, causing an emergency landing. Stumbling out of their damaged vessel, the crew found an undiscovered world, blanketed in snow, and teeming with wildlife. The crew set up a brief shelter while their engine was repaired, and spent that time watching, and learning about the new planet. After a week's time, and with the engines repaired, the Deliverer marked the coordinates on his map and returned to Sirisai.

On Sirisai the deliverer began to recruit; they formed a secret group, unbeknownst to the Republic. A group of people assembled, some looking for a new home, some looking for adventure, and some just wanting to make a name for themselves. Most of the first colonists were young, Resomii of ages between 14 and 20, and were prepared to leave everything behind. The Deliverer promised a simpler life, free from the gluttony of the Republic, and many listened. In 2473 the Deliverer gathered up their flock and returned to Zer’een, still unknown and unrecorded by the Republic. Numbering 34, the Deliverer and his followers brought only simple technology and primitive weapons, such as basic laser rifles and stun-spears. Some of the colonists were mechanics and engineers, to ensure that if anything were to break it could be repaired as quickly as possible with minimal supplies from the outside. 

The shelter made a year prior after the crash was still standing, and was quickly adapted to fit the needs of the new community. Eventually it became their Town Hall, and remains standing today. Crude buildings made of wood were erected around the shelter, creating the foundations of a simple village. At first the Saveelian hunted for their food, until the first farm bore fruit, or at least fungus, about a month after Landing Day. The farmers raised and slaughtered wildlife, and the colony grew. After collecting another flock of 21, the Deliverer had the ship that brought them there dismantled. Without any communications or record of Zer'een, the Republic would never know of Saveel's founding, or its survival. The Deliverer was the undisputed leader of the early colony, and was respected with an almost religious reverence.  The Deliverer passed away in 2482, and was buried under a cairn in the center of town, whereupon the eldest Sav stepped up in their place. That second leader of Saveel, now known as The Heir, is referred to in religious texts as a devout disciple of the Deliverer. The Heir established the Council of Elders to advise him, and help guide the colony, which it still does today. In time, the role of leader solidified into the office of High Priest, who speaks the word of God and the Deliverer.

The colony persisted like this for almost a century, unaware of the chaos that had wracked the Resomi society they had left behind. In time, tales of the homeworld and the technology there attained almost mythical qualities. The village grew into a town, and as older technology failed, simpler technology became more common. Resomii often traveled a ways from the colony, forming small hunting camps or religious retreats, but tended not to stray too far north so as to avoid warmer climates. Generations were born and died alone, until 2551.

A survey ship, owned by Grayson Manufactories entered Re'eshi on a routine mineral exploration mission. Suitably far away from SolGov, the captain was no doubt hoping to find valuable minerals close enough to Ahdomai to utilize some Tajara labor. After a number of uninteresting gas giants towards the outer edge of the system, the ship ran a survey of the inner planet, unbeknownst to them, Zer'een. After basic scans, the vessel found few interesting minerals, but were surprised to detect artificial light towards the pole of the southern hemisphere. A closer examination revealed a small tribal society. Intending to reap the rewards of first contact, the captain of the vessel landed and approached the village. Fortunately for him, his crew included a Resomi mining engineer, a refugee that had been hired by Grayson for being a mineral specialist; if that Resomi had not been present, it's likely the Grayson crewmen would have been killed or eaten when they were surrounded by a Saveelian hunting party. Facilitating communication, the Grayson Resomi was able to avoid an incident, and though the Saveelians were no new species, the Grayson captain  was able to negotiate with the Head Priest. 

Against the recommendations of the Council of Elders, the tribe would trade with Grayson in order to acquire supplies and replacement parts for the village's ancient generators. While it is currently forbidden for Saveelians to leave the colony, an infrequent trade with outsiders has continued, exchanging trinkets and exotic foodstuffs for basic technology and raw materials. In 2559, anthropologists were permitted to live in and study the village, where they continue to learn more about Saveelian culture and history.


## Government and Politics
Saveelian politics are heavily influenced by the Council of Elders, a body of the oldest 34 Resomii in the colony; they are seen as the wisest and most competent of all the colony. The High Priest still holds a great deal of power, and the stronger High Priests in history have called the shots. They are the only Resomii who are supposedly able to speak directly to God, and the Deliverer. As the conduit of divine will, it is unwise for a Council to overrule the High Priest if they value their positions and sometimes heads. In the religious hierarchy of the colony, the Elders act like disciples or ministers, spreading the will of the High Priest. Spiritual services held often, at least once a month, and other special times like holidays, deaths, or births. Many from the colony ask the High Priest for guidance when needed, and see them as a member of their families. If the current leader were to die the Council of Elders would hold elections within their midsts to find a replacement. Alongside religious duties, the High Priest is responsible for education and record keeping, meaning they control the information and history of the colony, as well as teach hatchlings before they take apprenticeships in the community. One member of the Council is always the "Chief Maker," who is the descendant of one of the original engineers the Deliverer brought, and is the only Sav that knows how to maintain the colony's remaining technology. Each Chief Maker passes their knowledge down to one of their children, a hereditary line that has remained unbroken for the colony's entire history.

### Foreign Relations
Re'eshi is outside of any claimed space for the time being, and is far enough from other trade routes or stellar clusters that it is likely to remain that way. It is not known if the Empire is aware of Saveel Colony, and if it is, it has made no attempts to contact the Saveelians. The closest major interstellar powers are the Confederacy of Man and Ahdomai, though neither have shown much interest in the system.
### Defense and Law Enforcement
Law enforcement is limited to a handful of Resomii responsible for guarding the Council and the High Priest, more of a bodyguard than a constabulary. Captured criminals are tried by the Council of Elders, with the High Priest casting a vote in the event of a tie. The most common punishments are exile and public penance, though execution isn't unheard of.

## Geography
* **Resources**: Zer'een is unremarkable from a mineral standpoint, crude metals are common, but not much else of value is under the surface. The colony itself has little to trade other than crafts, furs, and food. 
* **Flora and Fauna**: The polar regions are unusually diverse considering their extreme temperatures, with large animals ranging from bovine-like quadrupeds hunted by the locals to a number of large predators that the locals are hunted by. Unique among plant life on Zer'een are a number of species of evergreen trees that have incredibly durable and flexible wood.

The Colony of Saveel itself is located in a wooded valley on the larger of two southern continents, largely sheltered from winter windstorms, and has grown to cross a river that runs through the valley. The valley itself has been largely converted into farmland, growing a variety of tundra crops and feeding the local livestock. Hunting parties can range hundreds of miles in search of prey, including to the southern pole, and further north into warmer climates.

### Climate
Saveel is located past the southern polar circle of Zer'een, and only experiences minor climate shifts throughout the year. Temperatures remain below 0 degrees Celcius for almost half of an orbit. During the winter, sunlight is only visible for a few hours a day, leaving the colony pleasantly dark, for Resomii anyway, for much of the year. During summer, temperatures hover around 4 to 5 degrees Celcius, and rain is known during particularly warm years. Snowfall is typically light to moderate in the valley thanks to its mountain walls, allowing for some clear tundra farmland. 
### Terrain
Because of the long periods of freezing temperatures during the year, the river through the middle of the valley and colony is frozen to a depth of about a meter, meaning that Saveelians can only access fresh water from the waterfall at the head of the valley, or at certain points where the river is fast enough to avoid freezing. Otherwise they must cut a channel into the ice in order to get water.

## Culture
Saveelian culture only tangentially reflects modern imperial culture, or the culture of the Republic. Saveelians are more akin to prehistoric, tribal Resomii. Apprenticeships are still present, though often more for trades like blacksmith, or hunter, with little technical knowledge remaining. Courtesy rituals remain, though typically only for meeting the Elders or High Priest. Otherwise, Saveelians tend to be savage, and crass compared to other Resomii, making it hard for outsiders, even Resomii, to blend with the culture.

### Entertainment
Like their imperial cousins, Saveelians still play Wingball, albeit in a primitive fashion. An inflated bovine organ is used as a ball, and alongside wings, players are also permitted to use long paddles to assist with lift, considering the slightly higher gravity on Zer'een. Because striking with paddles is permitted, Saveelian Wingball can get rough, and broken bones are not uncommon. Matches are often the scene of betting using meat, weapons, or crafts. These matches can be huge events, with most of the colony in attendence in a stadium hewn from the rock outside the colony. The High Priest sits as the guest of honor at these matches, sometimes serving as an honorary referee.

## Economy
* **Imports**: Modern weaponry, power generators, raw materials for smithing, agricultural technology.
* **Exports**: Exotic foodstuffs, trinkets, historical documents and curiosities.

Trade within the colony takes the form of bartering. Common items include meat and other foodstuffs, simple crafts, and building materials. More valuable trade goods take the form of weapons, tools, livestock, and a narcotic lichen found sparsely in the area. Books approved by the High Priest can also be valuable, but books from before Landing Day, or information brought in by outsiders are prized by more independently-minded Saveelians. While visits by outsiders are infrequent, a number of Human ships periodically stop by, often looking to trade in curiosities. The Council of Elders keeps a small reserve of Thalers they receive in exchange for trade goods in case they need to barter for essential supplies, but most trade is direct exchange. Traders will often bring bits of technology or weaponry, which are highly popular among the Saveelians, but anyone looking to make a profit will probably be disappointed on Zer'een considering the lack of industry. While Grayson discovered the planet, it has staked no claim over the planet or system, and has largely remained clear of Saveel since first contact.

## Science and Technology
Saveel is very primitive, even compared to most frontier locations. Advanced technology is limited to imported or pre-Fall devices, mainly weapons or simple tools, however some computers and agricultural devices are present. Most other technology is approximately iron-age, with many simple hand tools being made from unrefined metal, and riding animals more common than any vehicles. The only spacecraft present are visiting the colony, and do not remain for long. In recent years, a more advanced quantum entanglement communication relay was installed to facilitate communication between anthropologists in the colony and their benefactors. Power is generated by a pair of pre-Fall Resomi fusion generators. Their output has dropped by almost 50% since installation, but are unlikely to fail catastrophically, at leat for now. A more modern solar generator was provided to the current High Priest as a gift by the anthropologists now living in the colony.

## Habitation
Other than the Town Hall and Temple of the Deliverer, which are made from parts of the original colony ship, Saveel's homes are largely wooden, with open windows and thatched or shingled roofs. Being resistant to the cold, Resomii don't mind the poor insulation of their basic homes, but other species may find living in Saveel frigid or even deadly. Homes are multi-story, with all members of one family living together under one roof, often sleeping in rooms adorned with furs and pelts, and eating communally on the first floor.

## Hazards and Crime
While organized crime isn't a threat, unlike many other frontier areas, non-Resomii aren't typically welcome without the blessing of the High Priest, so a gift or two would not go amiss to smooth over relations. A translator is also advised, either mechanical or organic, because the number of locals that are able speak Galactic Common can be counted on one hand. Outside of Saveel, several large predators are present, alonside the mundane danger of the cold, so visitors are advised not to venture outside of the valley.

## Notable Features

### Town Hall
The oldest building in Saveel, the Town Hall is a relatively small building used for meetings of the Council of Elders, or public meetings by Saveelians. It was constructed from spare materials available on the Deliverer's ship when they first crashed on Zer'een, and has been decorated with many pictograms and talon designs over the years.

### Temple of the Deliverer
Home of the High Priest, the Temple of the Deliverer is all that remains of the original ship that bore the Deliverer and their followers to Zer'een. The structure houses a large communal area for religious services in what used to be the cargo bay, as well as living quarters for the High Priest on the old bridge.
