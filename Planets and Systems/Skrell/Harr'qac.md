## History

Skrell first found this planet about year 2300 on their research flight. They found a smaller planet with developed life. They first tried sending signals towards the planet, but when they got no response, they used their large-scale scanners and surveillance drones to search for any intelligent lifeform activity, like cities or industry. When they found nothing, they decided to colonise the planet, as it resembled Qerrbalak in terms of climatic conditions.

## Geography

![Map][2]

*The map is somewhat illustrative.*

The planet consists of 40% ocean, but small lakes are very common, and planet itself seems nearly as humid as Qerrbalak. Some of the surface consists of swamps and jungles, but most is more like temperate forests or grasslands, which are more humid, rainy, and generally contain more water. There are three main continents: **Qrriuwenne**, the western continent; **Xi-Gerr-Ni**, the eastern continent; and **Gorron'arqeli**, the southern continent. Between the three, there is an ocean called **Kor'xil**, in which a quite large island of **Korm** resides.

### Flora and fauna

Most wild organisms living on the planet nowadays are the same species that existed there before the Skrell arrived. There are trees, simillar to the Earth broadleaf forests, but their leaves are larger as they contain lots of water. Fungi are common too, sometimes growing to the size of 3 metres. From animals, there are large mammals, called Friaq by Skrell, who feed on those large mushrooms, and therefore they only live in areas populated by them.

Another unusual species are the Xolm, microscopic organisms that are considered animals. They make a network of thin threads, which are, however, very strong. The networks are made of individual Xolm, who together behave as one larger animal. They are too small to be seen only by eye, but they move in the water, taking it with them. From the outside, it seems as if the part of water they live in was moving by itself. They usually make spherical networks. On one side, the density is lower and they can split at any time, forming a mouth-like hole. Using this, they swallow small animals or plants and then, when the "mouth" is closed, they poison their victim and digest its body. They are often seen as balls of water, sometimes with a smaller fish, a leaf or something larger inside.

Space carp migrations happen once in a few years and carps sometimes find their way to the planet.

## Skrellian society

Caste system is very important for Skrell of this planet. However, it works slightly differently than on Qerrbalak and colonies close to it. Most importantly, a Skrell from Harr'qac can decide to switch to another caste of his preference. This is not always the case, as the castes act as subcultures specialized to certain tasks and values, and as such, the children are raised in the mindset of the particular caste. However, sometimes a young Skrell has views that are diamertrically different from his caste and because of this feels like he/she does not belong into the caste. In this case, he/she can formally switch his caste. This is, however, not done very often, due to the freedom offered by the caste system itself.

Because of the bondings where at least one of the Skrell switched his/her caste, and the switching itself, it may be harder to tell a particular Skrell's caste just by his/her skin color in some families and you also need to notice their clothing and other specifics.

### Family life

Family life on Harr'qac is similliar to the one on Qerrbalak. Harr'qaci Skrell tend to bond fewer times in life. In some families, there is a recent tendency to put Qrri'Baqa into more contact with each other to strenghten their familial relations.

## Cities

Harr'qaci Skrell have built cities that, unlike on Qerrbalak, are not standing on stilts, but instead are directly on the ground. The cities are inside durable glass domes.

There are also some caste-specific cities, like military bases for Raskinta-Katish, large research centers for Malish-Katish or great Garden-cities for Talum-Katish. There is however no restricted access. Everyone can come to any of these for various reasons. The point is that the same way Skrell are divided into castes that focus on certain part of life of the society, some cities also focus on certain tasks. These are usually closer to other city-states and are supported and influenced by them.

#### Notable cities

* **Qrri'Mal**  
  The academy of Qrri'Mal is widely known for its research endeavours, which mainly aim into space. This makes Qrri'Mal highly attractive for researchers. The city-state is currently funding the construction of a nearby large research facility.
* **Skrriol**  
  Known for the abundance of natural resources near the city, much of the material used on Harr'qac comes from Skrriol. This includes materials from both, above and below the ground.
* **Vulx'Fi**  
  One of the first colonised places on the planet. It is widely known for its beautiful landscapes and is a major tourist spot. Giant fungi and Friaq live more densely around this city.
* **Kaux-Nira**  
  Situated on a small island, it is a major trading port.
* **Gor-Lo**  
  A famous Talum-Katish Garden-city. About 60% of the population are Talum-Katish. Another major tourist destination. Apart from the gardens, there are multiple museums, theaters and other cultural localities in or near the city. It is said that even Qerr-Katish from nearby systems travel to Harr'qac just to visit Gor-Lo. Life in the city is slow-paced and calm.
* **Nqli**  
  Another famous scientific spot, Nqli academy researchers are most known for their work in the fields of genetics and neurology. There is a notable giant fungi concentration around the city and some scientists focus on their use as a food source.
* **Scri'x**  
  The wide plains of Scri'x were the first colonised area of Harr'qac. Today, Scri'x operates an important spaceport. One of the first ships to land on Harr'qac is standing in the city centre.
* **Qal-Si**  
  Located on a cliff. This city is known for many trading companies that originate from here, however, also for its higher-than-average amount of organized criminality. 
* **Rel-Ma'xie**  
  Known for being the largest Harr'qaci city, as there are plenty of resources nearby and the city's quality of life is considered quite high. There are farms around the city to support it and also many other city-states with food.
* **University of Harr'qac**  
  The largest academy forms a city of itself. It's located on the island of Korm and many Skrell travel there for education in various specialisations. The University is divided into districts, one of which is the Government District where global decisions are taken.

### Living

Harr'qaci Skrell usually build circular houses, which often have many entrances around the ground floor. The usual living house for one family has 4 floors, the ground floor being entrance (since doors are at least on four sides), which can be also used for less private meetings or celebrations. First floor usually houses the kitchen, living room and toilet. Second floor contains private rooms or offices and usually a toilet too. Third floor is mostly the same as second, but it doesn't usually have a toilet. In he middle of each floor, there is either an elevator or a circular staircase. On the top of the houses, there are balconies, in which some Skrellian families have little gardens. There's also a new trend currently spreading in Skrriol and Qrri'Mal, to build narrow metal bridges between balconies of houses with simillar height, if the families are like meeting each other.

## Government

Similiarly to Qerrbalak, there are many self-governing city states. However, when establishing them, the Harr'qaci Skrell chose to implement some nove additions. While the city-states are mostly politically independent state subjects, they are organized in a global confederacy, and they decide on the common course of their actions together. Those decisions mostly concern, besides other internal things, their exterior policy; however, while being in agreement, there is usually enough space for the city-states to vary their implementation according to their specific situation. This does not mean that the common decisions are compulsory - the individual city-states can choose to implement them their own way or not implement them at all. However, seeing this cooperation as a much more efficient process, the city-states of Harr'qac usually deviate only slightly from the common decision, as they themselves usually do not *want* to deviate much from the common goal.

This confederacy is divided into three sub-confederacies - one for each continent - for the sake of easier organization in general, and to make discussions concerning continent-specific situations more efficient. Representing each of the continets are the Qerr-Kirris, backed by their councils. They meet in the Government District of the University of Harr'qac.

In case of a serious crisis, when the sub-confederacy and Qerr-Kirri system would not be quick enough to react, the General Council, or Qrri-Kerr'a, takes place, with either a representative or the Qerr-Skrria personally representing each city-state.

### Foreign relations

* **Skrellian space** - Warm and active contact, trade, travel and cultural exchange. Harr'qac is a part of the Skrellian space after all.
* **Sol Central Government** - Amicable and warm due to the history between the Skrell and the Humans.
* **Terran Confederacy** - Formal contact, mostly trading, due to being further away. The conflict between the Sol Central Government and the Terran Confederacy tends to be overlooked, as Harr'qaci Skrell feel they shouldn't favoritise any side of it.
* **Moghes Hegemony** - No formal contact.
* **Ahdomai** - Not much, minor trade.
* **Dionaea Gestalts** - Amicable.
* **The Positronic Union** - Contacts are being established on the basis of research.
* **Resomi Empire** - Minor contact through complex trade routes.
* **Free Trade Union** - Minor trade contact, rather supportive.
* **Human corporate space** - Trade contacts.

## Education

The most famous academy of Harr'qac is The University of Harr'qac. It was not originally a part of any city state, but a city was built around it during its construction. It's located on the island of Korm. The university takes almost the whole island, with lots of parks, services, leisure areas and the like. It is supported by other cities, as the global government meets there.

Same as on Qerrbalak, each city state also has its own academy.

## Economy

Harr'qac is considered a wealthy colony, with an excellent standard of living.

The economic system is basically identical to that of Qerrbalak - money is created for a finite period, after which is loses value - because there wasn't a reason to change this. However, some city states take a more direct approach to the human currency problem: Kaux-Nira and Qal-Si, both being major trading locations and the latter also having a lot of criminality, are currently keeping track of any human money that enters the cities - citizens of those two cities are obliged to annually report the amount on human currencies in their possession. They also heavily encourage their citizens to exchange the human money for Skrellian money. Some other city states are calling to their respective Qerr-Kirris for advice. This issue is currently a reason for a lot of high priority sessions in the Government District of the University of Harr'qac and many researchers, managers and diplomats are trying to find a viable solution.

### Food and water

Water is not an issue on a world like Harr'qac. It is easily accessible and most city-states are able to provide clean water to their citizens by themselves.

Food is produced by variety of city-states, some of them large, such as Re-Ma'xie which exports food to other city-states on every continent; some smaller, sustaining themselves and just one or two nearby city-states.

### Natural resources

Harr'qaci Skrell enjoy the abundance of many materials required for advanced industry and science. There are also jungles and forests, however several city-states have restricted woodcutting due to environmental concerns, therefore wood is more luxurious on Harr'qac and it is imported from other city-states and also from other colonies.

### Infrastructure

Some large city-states have space ports of great importance, such as **Scri'x**, **Qrri'Mal**, **Kaux-Nira** and **Rel-Ma'xie**. 

To travel and transport stuff on the planet, the Harr'qaci Skrell prefer using the means with very little effect on the ecosystem. Because of that, planes and hoverpods are preferred, as well as, in lesser extent, land vehicles that aren't harmful to the environment. Water transportations is important too, where applicable. Roads and railways would be considered too damaging, however, they may be found between a nearby city-states, if the transport amount is large enough.

#### Energy

Being ecology oriented, the Skrell tend to use the clean energy sources, mostly solar arrays. Wind and water power plants are used as well. There are no fossil fuel based facilities.

### Research

The individual city-state academies, as well as the University of Harr'qac, perform research in various areas. **Kaux-Nira**, for example, is well know for its transportation research and optimalization, as it is located on an island. Moreover, **the University** is conducting, among other areas, Bluespace research, as is **Qrri'Mal**, which is also interested very much in biotechnology. 

Also, there is a global space exploration incentive, including the Harr'kelm system and its bodies, but also the outer space. Some of these projects are shared with city-states on other planets and other organizations.

### Tourism

Harr'qac also enjoys a steady influx of tourists. Most of them are Skrell from nearby systems who want to see the exotic nature of Harr'qac's native life in their own eyes. **Gor-Lo**, a Garden-city, is too visited a lot by tourists.
