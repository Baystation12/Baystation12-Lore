## History


Not much is known about the history of the city, altough the few records the unathi have seems to indicate that it is at the least three hundred years old, or even older. If anyone wishes to know anything about their history, they must ask the matriarchs, who keep track of the events in the traditional way, preserved on the family Skeins.


## Government and Politics


Lead by the highest caste, the warlords, the strongest which rules them all, on paper. Reality is quite different from this. The old society is slowly crumbling, interstellar companies are gaining more and more power, and the old castes do not function properly anymore. Some from the caste of peons can rise higher then some of the warriors, due to their talent. Meanwhile, the goverment is desperately trying to get hold of the city, and tries not to let more and more power slip from it’s hands


### Foreign Relations

Trade relations with human companies, very close connection to NT. To other clans they are usually quite passive, do not wish to wage more wars, focusing more on commerce and their own advancement. In political meetings, the leaders do everything to make sure that they are not seen as people who slel their own out to others (which is while not true, may be the perception), and try to act like they still hold traditions dearly, to avoid further conflicts. Altough, it is true that companies do exploit them, they try to get as much as they can from deals.


### Defense and Law Enforcement


The warrior caste forms the body of the law enforcement and the army, but with traditions being much more loose, weaponry in other hands is not uncommon. Most unathi could be conscripted, in times of war.

Human companies employ their own security.

Becuse of being more advanced, their troops are usually better equipped then their neighbours, though they still lack the numbers which would be enough to rule over them, thus they were only able to subjugate weaker, nearby clans.


## Geography

* **Resources**: Mainly acess to fuel, most notably diesel, water which is a precious material on Moghes, and minerals of varying nature, mostly those which are useful for the varying types of industry.

* **Flora and Fauna**:


Flora: Trees, vines across the grounds. Overall, like a rainforest.


Fauna: Sissaliks, Threshbeasts and Stoks are the most common animals


Unqiue Fauna:


R’ssiz:

About 1m long burrowing worm, which lives around the Poles. It is an omnivore, it eats everything it finds, but prefers meat. It rarely preys on large animals, but it’s mouth is filled with hundreds of small sharp teeth. Also, it’s bite is highly poisionous, it first paralyzes the prey, then it slowly causes system failure. The most notorious trait is that the worm loves to plant it’s eggs into dead animals, or even unathi, so after hatching they have something to eat. Highly hated by Unathi, this being is killed when found. Becuse of this reason, it’s already not high population dropped significantly around Unathi settlements.





### Climate


Does not stray away from any other area in the Poles. As in any other Pole, there are two seasons, both long and can be quite harsh. A wet and a dry season. The period of sunlight is very extreme too, changing from nearly the whole day, to a few hours, depending on the month.


### Terrain


The city made the natural terrain more even, becuse of it’s expansions.Orginally, in a valley, but since then it grown significantly. The older parts of the city were orginally in the middle of the valley, but they were replaced by new buildings since then. It is the de facto centre of the city.


## Culture


The city while holds the image of following traditions, in fact the old system is falling apart, with human influence being more and more obvious which each passing year. Becuse of the fear of their neighbours, who are more sensitive, they maintain a picture of a traditional soceity, but the process still goes on.


In many senses, they keep old values, but how deep it really goes, depends on the districts. The more human populated, are usually very lax, it is made to accomodate humans living there. For high prices, one can even maintain a way of life similar to other colonies, altough, becuse the intrest only started growing for it recently, it is still not the large market.


The caste system itself, can be seen cracking also. While the leadership keeps a tight grasp on their place as rulers, all other castes started to mingle. Lowborn scientists often raising higher, then any peon would have, in the traditional society, warriors working as underlings to those they are supposed to be above, and the list goes on. Only the outer, less advanced areas seem to keep to their old way of life, but that may not last for long.


How the people react to corporations, is an interesting situation too. Most who enjoy the benefits of working together, seem to be approving, and usually support more and more to come, making their lives easier, and providing better conditions, new technology. However, those who are too poor, or just very traditionalist, see this as the force which corrupts their old way of life, and those unathi who accept them, are turning to their back to the „real” unathi values.


One of the oldest, and still present traditions, is the worship of the Precursors. While the youth seems to doubt their divinity, the older generation are quite devout. This does not clash with collaboration with the humans, most who do so, often say that they would wish for unathi to prosper and to explore new horizons, and honor their memory that way.


Traditional entertainment for unathi, like pit fighting, is still present, altough becuse of the human influence more and more customs are being adopted.A few cinemas, „modern” bars, and fields for human sports can be found here and there. But interestingly enough, some sports are effected by the unathi culture. Ones with phyiscal contact tend to be more lax in rules, allowing a more brutal display of strength.



## Economy


* **Imports**: Human technology and tools

* **Exports**: Engineering goods, Weapons and technology, mostly to other clans


The city manufactures goods with the help from imported technology and tools, and sells them to other less advanced clans. While they are not an industrial powerhouse, their high level of technology gives them an edge over many of their rivals. They are a major hub on the Southern Pole. Their most relevant partner is NanoTransen.



## Science and Technology


While it is the most advanced of all unathi cities, mostly due to the import of foregin technology, they are far from being the most powerful when it comes to industry. They mostly manufacture things others can’t, and profit from their advanced technology, but as most of those are owned by human corporations, service sector is the main driving force of the city. Industrial products (which they, themselves do not produce) are often imported from other cities, or even from offworld sources.



## Habitation


The Human Quarter is, clearly designed for the newcomers. The style is a blend of marsian and the traditional architecture of the unathi. Shops, cinemas, hospitals, are abudant here, compared to how many live there, but becuse one of the richest portion of the city lives here, they can afford that. Corporate employees make sure to use their realtively great wealth, and carve out a life similiar to what they are used to. Only a few unathi live here, most notably those with higher social standing who are attracted to the human way of life. This is in the very center of the city, often having squares and a few parks, with relatedable flora for the humans. Gated communites are very common, as some humans prefer as little contact with the more „lowly” unathi, as possible.


Those districts which are more modern, are in a circle about the Human Quarter. This is where the unathi leaders live, in imposing, buildings, which are clearly modern, but still keep the traditional shapes, and overall asthetic. One can get reasonable healthcare, and goods from the outside work. Those few, who can call themselves the brain of the city also live here. Some humans also live here, who are more intrested in unathi culture, or simply can’t afford the expensive housing in the center. Schooling, is also more and more widespread here, with each passing year, classes grow, and more unathi learn useful skills.


Poorer districts suffer from numerous issues. The goverment often neglects this area, only doing a few things, here and there, but mostly for the looks. Unathi around here often struggle to find employment, or must be content with a low quality of life. Houses are built from what they can find. Healthcare is next to non-existant, schools are rare. While unathi are hardy, lives are short here, due to sickness, poor quality of food, or to crime. Many work in unsafe conditions, which also takes a toll on their health.




## Hazards and Crime


Crime, even though unathi are quite agressive in nature, is in control at least in the areas where there is enough money and power to grant that. The poor areas are much less controlled, and thus crime is alarmingly more common.

Smaller clans often feel opressed, or that they do not posses the same rights and priviliages then Nels’thars, and while they are not power enough to do anything about it, hate crime is not unheard of, in fact it became more and more widespread with the level of technology rising, and the gaps between the socail groups becoming wider and wider.

Some, if not most of the disgruntled think that humans are in a large part responsible for it. They see them as those who exploit them, take what is rightfully their’s, and do not respect their culture and customs. Those Unathi who are see as collaborators with them, are often treated just the same if not the worse, when it comes to hate crime.

While this is currently not a problem, it might become one, in the near future.


Violence between clans, is also an issue the society faces. With the large number of smaller clans, all below Clan Nels’thar, tension is self evident. The most common target, is of course, the ruling clan, but it is not unheard of for the clans to attack eachother for any reason, be it one of true importance for one of the clans, or just something which one side can use to initiate conflict. This is more of a problem in the more traditionalist districts, in the central ones, there is a great effort to show off the strenght of the Nels’thars, and that nobody can get away with such crimes. In case such happen, they are met with a swift response, as the ruling class takes this as something compromising their legitmacy.


Humans living in the city, brought another new set of problems in, regarding law. The very honorbound nature of the unathi often clash with humans used to ”proper” laws, and courts. While humans expect their rights to be defended by the city, unathi often seem to discard it, and expect trial by combat, more often then not. This is another reason why some struggle against humans, and their ”puny” ways. Both sides are known trying to show dominance in this matter, often ending in deaths of the involved. It is yet another issue which requires some sort of solution, or in the long term, may result in great problem for the society. Right now, however, the situation seems to be under control.



## Restricted Information


Those who posses skills which can be used by intellstellar companies might get offers they can’t refuse. While this does not happen often, it is not something which greatly suprises people. Many of these unathi have families on Moghes, only a few take them to human space.



## Notable Features


The city possess is spaceport, several companies have footholds. Most new technology is first adapted here, and later this is where it will be manufactured and sold to other unathi.


In the more wealthier parts of the city, Unathi and humans live in suprisingly modern homes, resembling human colonies. In the poorer areas it is a strange mix of modern materials and traditional housing, and in the most poor areas, people use what they can find, living in pathetic huts.


As mentioned before, it is notable that they are much more lax on traditions then any other areas. Corporations have much more power here, then in any other city on the planet. So called „wild capitalist” practises are common, as corporations try to get the hold of industry and resources. They are certainly making progress, gaining more and more power with each passing year, which is noticed by many unathi.


Those who get nothing out of the deal are enraged by this, and tensions continue to grow. Cultures and customs often clash, and it is yet to be seen what will be the outcome, altough, it is near certain that the unathi will have to get used to things alien to them, as humans certainly won’t adapt their way of life. This is yet another problem the city must solve, or the consequences may be dire.



### Main Social Movements


”Progressives”:


Not to be confused by human progressive movements, the unathi progressives would be considered very conservative by those standards. They are supportive of traditions regarding family, names, and such ( for example anyone who suggest that females would be equal in any sense would be laughed at and ridiculed), however they feel that the old caste system of the unathi is no longer in the best intrests of the species. Religion is a matter they are quite divided on, but it does not cause significant tension within the movement, as it is not relevant for their goals. They are very pro-cooperation with humans. They consider it as a great opportunity to become even stronger and to gain more influence. Those few unathi who work for interstellar companies are not judged by them, they find this fact something which is the result of the joined efforts, which are in the end, positive in their eyes. Most of them are from the districts which benefit the most from human contact. In other parts of the city, the movement simply does not exist.


”The Traditionalists”


They are the counterpart of the ”Progressive” movement, sort of an extreme reaction to the human influnce. The movements fights against every small change in traditions, seeing change as the path to the death of their race. They, react with great hostility and quite often with violence towards anyone who supports ideas opposing their’s. The core of the movement is in the poorer districts, who blame their bad state on the humans, and ”those who serve them”, using them as scapegoats to fuel their anger, which is the prime reason why it would be unreasonable to expect the movement to disband anytime soon.






### Sub Feature


It has better schooling and education then all other cities on the planet, and while general education is still not something overly common, those unathi who have some knack for craft or science are usually trained here. It is the real Think Tank of Moghes, and many of the brightest minds gather here. Here, even higher education exists, on a level which makes those learning here, a valuable workforce. Above else their main focus is R&D, and adaptation of foregin tech, but their advancments on the fields of medicine are notable as well.
