## History

The skein of the Jesska Clan is the oldest in all of Moghes. Often called "The Skein of Moghes" by offworlders, and visitors of the great city, this skein holds the history of Mumbak, or the parts of it still intact from two millenia of war, famine, disease, and all sorts of other disasters that have befallen its people. As stated, the oldest dates on the skein detail the first village, "Mumbak" was the leader of the village, and thus his name stuck with its people. Over time, the village built and built and built itself into a city. Tribals raided the city, taking its goods and animals. The first "Kaahnepo," or the first usage of the term, came from this skein to detail Jesska Mumbak, who would stand against the tribals and enemies of the great city. Jesska Mumbak would birth the Jesska Clan, who would go onto rule Mumbak for, as far as historians can tell from the skeins, 1700 years.

The Jesska Clan built Mumbak into the prospering, sprawling city that it is today, a nightmare of favelas, mini-clan states, industrial sinkholes, precursor ruins, and diesel yards. They would lose control of the city due to the failures of their last Kaahnepo, Aiek Jesska, who would fall at the hands of Karyat Skalwa, the great-father of Mumbak's current Kaahnepo. 


## Government and Politics

Mumbak is the Unathi culture in full swing. Unlike Si'gek Nels'thar which became advanced due to offworlders investment, Mumbak was made powerful by Unathi. 1000s of different clans and vassals live in the city, which is seperated into 48 different districts by the Skalwa Clan. With the Kaahnepo onto, 48 Jukkepos control the different districts, each one of which is a warlord from their district who took power. The fighting over Jukkepos is bloodthirsty, with Clan Wars and Banes prevalent throughout some of the more diverse districts. Order is set up in such a way that the only Unathi who can challenge the Kaahnepo for rule, are the Jukkepos. 

Within the 48 districts are the Clans, each of which controls his and his own. There is no law enforcement in Mumbak, just the Unathi Code of Honor which many Human Scholars would see as comparable to Hammurabi's Code. One Human Historian while in the great city watched an Unathi get his tail cut off. His markings denotated him as a far different clan from the ones cutting his tail. When the Historian asked why this was happening, an Unathi Worker said, "He stole two eggs from the other Clan."

Along with the distinct, brutal form of clan-politics that make up Unathi Society, there are the corporations from offworld, trying to find a foothold in the industrial capital of Moghes, some of which can be considered as bloodthirsty as the Clans.

The Jesska's, though no longer the most powerful or plentiful clan in the city, still control the Skein of Mumbak. They are often seen more as Holy Figures, rather than a Clan, with rumors circulating of their Warlords thinking of turning the Clan into what would resemble a Holy Order.

### Foreign Relations

Mumbak is the center for Moghesian Trade, where Si'gek Nels'thar is the Hub for the Offworld Market. In Si'gek Nels'thar you can find the latest things from Humanity, such as cheeseburgers and laser weapons, but in Mumbak you can find the Vibra-Weapon Markets, and Moghes' largest Diesel Yard. Often at odds with Durzakrag Fortress, the Hub of the Diamond Peaks, due to the animosity the Skalwas hold for the Duruks, the leading clan of the Fortress.


### Defense and Law Enforcement

Same as in any of the city states, law enforcement is done by the clans, with order kept by the Jukkepos Clans. Mercenary Groups, of Unathi of course, can be found throughout the sprawling cityscape. Defense of the City is left in the hands of the Kaahnepo and their clan, along with any militia they can pull from the rest of the city, though no rival clan has been brave enough to attack Mumbak since before the fall of the Jesskas.


## Geography

* **Resources**: As the Industrial Powerhouse of Moghes, the resources pouring in and out of Mumbak are crazy. Diesel Fuel is the most commonly found thing in the city, with a gallon costing .50 thalers. Offworld Enviromentalists are worried about the effects the rampant Industrialization and continued growth of the city will have on the environment, but Unathi already live in a Dead World.

* **Flora and Fauna**:


Flora: Not much, to say the least. Mumbak stretches between great Rainforests and the Savannahs, but the further in the city you go, the higher up it's built, and the less plants you'll find.

Fauna: Exists about the same as the Flora, but certain animals have come to adapt. such as:

The Yuums:
Yuums would be comparable to a hairless, sand-colored monkey, whose tail is more like a scorpions, and whose body is the about the size of a large dog. Often in packs of 10-30, Yuums thrive in the industrial waste, and trash of the great city, running across rooftops, occasionally killing offworlders with their dangerous, dangerous tails, and causing a ruckus amongst the markets.




### Climate

Varies from the northern part of the city to the southern, depending on where you are. Thick clouds of smog come sometimes too.

### Terrain

Mumbak covers a huge swathe of land, and is no way stopping expanding into more land.

## Culture

To describe the culture of Mumbak would be to describe the culture of Moghes, of the Unathi. Mumbak is a truly Cosmopolitian world of the Unathi Modern Society, with hundreds of miles in every direction, thousands of clans, industrial stacks, docks, dieselyards, everything. Many Unathi would call it the Modern Unathi City, while others would give that title to the far more advanced Si'gek Nels'thar

## Economy


* **Imports**: Some Human Tools for Industry

* **Exports**: Engineering goods, resources, vehicles, Industry. All to other clans

The city exports to most if not all the other city states due to its incredibly high industry value.


## Science and Technology

While not nearly the most advanced technologically, Mumbak is an example of the best of the best in pure Unathi Engineering. Many marvel at how the strange machinery of the re-worked Precursor Tech and Unathi Engineering work, but the Workers keep their secrets close to their clan. The Breacher suits are a closely guarded secret of the more powerful clans in Mumbak, as are many pneumatic weapon designs.

## Habitation

Most of the city can be described as one, great big Favela, with the city building out further and further, and the deeper into the city you get, the older and taller it gets. A lot of the old districts may not even have anyone but criminals and miscreants living in them anymore. It would take over a day to two days to completely cross the sprawling megatropolis. 


## Hazards and Crime

Crime is generally handled by the Jukkeppos and their Clans, with harsh punishments handed out to any who break Honor Codes. Banes happen often throughout the city, and everyday more Guwandi leave. It's not strange to see at least one dead body if you're visiting the city. Drugs are smuggled into the city from offworlders, as are other illegal things for the lower class Unathi to partake in. Jukkeppos don't really do anything about it, but often the practices in the city will seem extremely corrupt or un-justice like to offworlders such as Humans.



## Notable Features

The Jesska Hall, the original center of the city, is a great, sandstone temple right in the middle of Mumbak. Though the Skalwas once thought of turning it into their home, they left it for the Jesskas. It is often a pilgrimage site for travelling Unathi seeking to learn the history of Moghes.

The sprawling city also connects to a underground network from a bunker that the city grew around, and expanded. The Undercity of Mumbak is about like the top, but far more criminal activity takes place down below. Offworlders are told to avoid the area at all costs. Dishonorable attacks and murders happen quite often, with the call of a Bane being nothing more than a stab in the back.

The largest Diesel Yard in all of Moghes is in Mumbak, over 25,000 vehicles travel in and out of it's perimeter every day, with tons of gallons of fuel being used as frequent as water in the Desert. The rampant growth of Mumbak's industrial sector as led the way for an increasing development into fossil-fuel powered technology, including towards more spaceworthy means.
