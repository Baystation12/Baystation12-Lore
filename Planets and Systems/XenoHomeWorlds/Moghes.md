# Moghes 
![landscape][1]
The planet **Moghes** is home of the [Unathi](baystation12.net/Species/Unathi/Unathi), and is dominated primarily by deserts, and deep crags that go far into the ground, filled with tall jungle trees or blistering irradiated hellholes as a result of an ancient nuclear disaster. Evidence of this previous, older race manifests itself in the form of ruins that dot themselves across the surface. Traces of swamp-land and jungles are present, showing that, at one time, Moghes was a lush world filled with a thriving ecosystem. The planet is 1/6 smaller than the size of Earth, and it's only sun is close enough to make it uncomfortable for non-natives. It has a single moon. Despite the doomsday event that burned away most of the plant life and water on the planet, Moghes is still home to three large oceans called Malawi and Tanganyika, and Iksess, but each of them are comparably to the Dead Sea on Earth. Lakes, the very few that exist, are often extremely irradiated, with most clean water being found underground. Sand storms are common at the equator and rain is only semi-common at the polar caps which have become tropical oasis compared to their ancient days as arctic palaces

## Overview

Estimated population is around 2,000,000,000. Moghes Government is a loose system that can be best described at feudal. 15 City-States make up the Capitals of Moghes, each of which is controlled by a different very powerful clan, outlying settlements of varying sizes look to these capitals for protection and trade, paying tribute in resources or military assistance. While there are no outright alliances between these city states due to disinterest or paranoia, there is an understanding outright war would be too costly unless it were a matter of honour or pride. Often conflict between clans is handled by one-on-one combat, or open battle, rather than secretive raiding or guerilla warfare, as those are not considered honorable. The largest of these city states is Mumbak, The Grand City, in the Northern Pole. Nearly 30 different clans populate its borders, and the city itself is a sprawling network of favelas, markets, rusty ports and even rustier vehciles. 

## Astrology

**Star/Sun:** Uueoa-Esa, roughly translated to burning mother.

**Moghes:** See above

**Ouere (Oh-erie):** Second closest planet to the burning mother and somewhat close to Moghes, oddly a planet heavily forested in swamp, jungle and plain with very few lakes and some very harsh, carnivorous flora, most of it's water is underground in sub-geo lakes and rivers... Rumors about colonies of very exploration minded Unathi circle it, but who can tell? Roughly 2/3rds Moghes' size.

**Yeora:** The planet with the biggest AU gap in the 'Esa system, a large blue gas giant with a trio of moons that's suspected to account for it's distance from the other 3 bodies, some energy corporations wonder if it's worth harvesting for valuable gasses, but aren't hopeful...It doesn't help most city-state councils and warlords wouldn't be happy with Skrell or Human establishment in a system which could be /their/ rightful resource.

**Yoos:** A tiny (1/8th the size of Moghes) frozen planet at the very edge of the Uueoa-Esa system of very little note.

## Geography

There are 5 distinct regions on Moghes, with the poles making up one on their own. As well, mountains of diamonds line the ranges of Moghes, tall and strong many years after the apocalypse, though the gem is of no value to the Unathi. Deep reserves of phoron lie beneath the ranges, and many offworlders looking to get rich travel there to collect it. Many do not return. The deep Crags are often filled with swamps and tall jungles, with the tops of the trees reaching just above the ground level and unknowing travellers falling to their deaths thinking it a forest. great towers of metal and strange, glass-dunes dot the land. The glass-dunes are often revelled by offworlders due to their strangeness. Nearer the poles, vast savannahs cover the lands, with trees who's canopies fill out like giant umbrellas across the size. The irradiated lakes sprout up here and there, and the diamond peaks fill the horizon. The highest of the diamond peaks is taller than the Olympus Mons of Mars and is often used as a point of direction for Unathi. The swamp lands near the oceans are filled with toxic gases and thick brush that is hard to get through. Beaches are hard to find, as they are usually swamps instead. The boater clans often call these Swamps home, as they prefer them to the deserts, savannahs, or tropical poles. 

* **The Poles:** The tropical lands of the far north and south, the Poles are the trade capitals of the planet, as offworlds hate to travel into the deeper interior of the planet. The city states in these areas are often some of the more powerful and technologically advanced due to their trade with offworlders, and they usually have the largest water reserves as well. 
* **The Savannahs:** Another region, the Savannahs are great flatlands that are close to the Poles. They're often the homes of Clans due their heat, and ability to grow food. As well, the Savannahs have the largest underground reserve of water, which is controlled by the most powerful clan of the region.
* **The Deserts:** the largest region of Moghes, the Deserts cover most of the globe. The ancient ruins are often found in them, as well as the Metal Monuments and the Glass Dunes. The deep crags that the low jungles fill are often found here, and often are filled with decomposing corpses from travellers who aren't paying attention. 
* **The Swamp Beaches:** As said, the swamps of that line against the oceans are often filled with toxic gas, with boater clans that live near them. None are entirely explored, and the salt water that flows into them makes that even harder. They're extrmely dangerous to all who enter, but a wonder for zoologists and botanists of all kinds due to the many plants and animals that live there, such as the Dorak, a cap-headed, hairless jaguar with six legs.
* **The Diamond Peaks:** The diamond peaks are the coldest place on the planet besides the humid, moderate tropical poles. The Diamond Peaks are the home to many mining operations by offworlders and travellers due the wealth of diamonds and the deep reserves of phoron beneath the ground. The clans of the mountains are a harsher people, and are generally less open to offworlders coming to their lands. Often they have pogroms of offworlder operations or camps in the areas, making the region very dangerous for Non-Unathi.

## Flora

The majority of plants in the Deserts are hardy, tough, and not really much to look at. Most are scrubby bush with thick, waxy leaves and tough grasses that sprout in unexpected places. Arid, waterless areas do produce plants. These are very hardy, do not require much water to be kept alive, and are about as pleasant to eat as fake ferns in an office. However, those that grow near the water-rich soil of Oases are another matter entirely. These may bear fruits or flowers that are used in Unathi cuisine, and are brightly colored to attract herbivores. Many of these fruits taste sour and juicy, or are milky like coconuts. The great trees of the Savannahs are massive and height, and their canopies very, very vast, almost like a football field in size across the sky. The Tropical Poles are very similar to rainforests, and have everything from massive trees to vines across the ground, and man-eating traps.  The Swamps are even more mysterious, and dangerous, but brightly colored with many different hues due to the poisonous variety of the flora that exists there. The Diamond Peaks has almost nothing besides hardy, leafless trees. 

## Fauna

Furred animals are rare on Moghes. Most are either scaled, covered in sharp quills, or feathered. Threshbeats are one of such creatures. They resemble large canines and come in at around 1.4 meters tall, with an average weight of about 160 pounds. They are quadrupedal and are entirely covered in sharp, poisonous quills, which is what makes them so desirable as cavalry. Threshbeats follow a pack mentality and are predators by nature, though they can be domesticated given enough patience and time.

Another animal native to Moghes is the Duneworm, that resemble large, pale-colored worms that favor hibernating in the sands. Completely blind, they slumber until they wake to mate or if a nearby creature disturbs the area round them, at which point they snatch them up in a quick lunge before returning to their sleep. They are often hunted by Unathi for their meat, who will usually track them by gathering threshbeast puppies, or by letting those brave enough to stomp around outside dunes. When the creature lunges out of the sand, it will be met with a hail of grenades or javelins.

Sissalik are large, gecko-like creatures that serve as the workhorses of Unathi society. They are used as cavalry mounts, and while not as dangerous as threashbeasts they are far quicker on their feet. Their main use, however, is much like that of oxen to humans. They are often used as transportation as well as animals to pull caravan wagons or simply domestically raised and then slaughtered for their meat.

Ogashes are great beasts, somewhere around the size of half a football field. THey have great, outer shells, somewhat like turtles, and the rough, hairless skin of a furless mammal. Their eight-eyed heads with giant maws are a sight to be hold, and their ability to cover great tracts of land with great weight on their backs is an ample aid to the nomadic tribes of Moghes. Though are often rare, there as many as 500 Ogashes domesticated by clans. The killing of Ogashes is completely forbidden by all Clans, as they are such an important part of some Unathi culture, that their deaths would be like burning a Clan's skein. Ogashes themselves live for around 300 Earth Years, and are often called "Giant Spider Turtles" by Human Tourists.


Stoks are a small species of reptile native to Moghes, ranging from two, to three feet tall with colorful scales and feathers adorning their head, they stand on two legs and have short arms, the legs being digigrade. They keep to oasis's due to their colors which provide camouflage and distance from predators such as duneworms. Keeping in packs so that when they are threatned, they will swarm an attacker and take it down by sheer flanking and numbers. They're an omnivorous species, keeping themselves fed on either predators, or oasis fruits, also been known to be kept as pets for both Unathi on Moghes, and other species with taste in exotic animals.

Doraks are a species of the Salt-swamps, and they resemble the ancient Earth animal of a jaguar, if a jaguar had six legs, no fur, and a bone cap on its head. They range from three to five feet tall, and around six or seven feet in length, with their six legs causing much of this length. The split tail on the back is usually a variety of colors, and is a common sign of being in heat. They're solitary animals, but pups can often be seen with their mothers. They're carnivorous as well, feeding on other animals in the Swamps.

Gnars are a hardy animal of the Deserts, usually found around Glass Dunes. They're similar to centipedes in shape, but in size they're nearly three feet long, and much thinner. Often, clans will capture them and use them for ritual ceremonies, as they are a delectable meal. They are scrap animals mostly, going after decaying carcasses more than anything else.

Losseks come from the diamond peaks entirely, never venturing far out. They somewhat resemeble gorillas in shape and size, but their fur is far thicker, and their face makes you think more of a spider than an ape. The giant, red beasts are known to live in caves in small groups of six or seven, and very very aggressive to non-Losseks. They're omnivores, and are keen to eating unweary adventurers. 

## [City States](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Cities)

There are plenty of villages, settlements and other such things across the planet of Moghes, but the real capitals are the City-States.
