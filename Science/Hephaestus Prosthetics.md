# Hephaestus Industries Prosthetic Lineup

As of general position on the prosthetics market, Hephaestus is definitely not negligible, but not the greatest either, that position should be held by Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals. Hephaestus has seen some cooperation with them, namely during development of X-06 and X-07 models.

Hephaestus offers more bland and somewhat cheaper prosthetics then the lineup I lay out here, but that sees little demand as the audience that would go for this kind of products go to other companies where they can get it at a more reasonable price.

Hephaestus is focusing their prosthetics on mil-spec, specialized products, with most sets operable even if not the entirety of it is ordered (for example the model can feature all limbs, but only legs may be ordered, and it works accordingly).

The X series features models specialized for a given role in the military, or for soldiers of fortune, and are priced adequately to that. This makes for a relatively low volume sold which results in Hephaestus' undeniable, but still not top position on this market. Although the prosthetics were developed for military at first, some of the models are sold to wealthy citizens.

Less powerful versions stripped of some features or replaced with lower quality components can be ordered. They do retain their model name, but are only classified as Hephaestus Industries Fidelity (HIF) models. Those see comparatively higher demand to X series.

## Prosthetic models

Honoring the naming scheme that the TSC sticks to, the main HIF and X series models are Prometheus, Minotaurus, Helios, Icarus, Adrasteia, Ares, and Nostos.

### X-01 Prometheus

Prometheus has been developed as one of the first, to alleviate as many issues as possible for veterans that may have lost a limb, or other body part. However this does not only include issues associated with getting used to the new body part, but also the social and official aspects that were associated with any prosthetic compartment, as at the time of development, biomechanical augmentations were on the rise, causing moral disputes over both actual augmentations and regular prosthetic replacements. They saw use not just with veterans, but with wealthy citizens as well.

The augment was designed to look entirely natural to look, feel, smell, as well as to fool all conventional sensory arrays. It is capable of simulating response to some injuries like capillary bleeding, fractures, and bruises. It is even possible to allow administration of medicine and extraction of blood samples via a special channel that ends in a small reservoir near the elbow, thighs, and wrists, that also accomodate simulation of deeper cuts, but only for a very limited time to prevent actual harm to user, only giving time to mend the 'wound' to prevent suspicion.

It also features simulation of pulse of adequate amplitude on various spots of the Prometheus, synchronized with the actual pulse and blood pressure to correspondingly reflect the vital signs. Muscular activity is actually not shielded, making it detectable by bioelectric sensors just as with regular limbs, and if under strain it is made to be visibly contracting adequately.

This prosthetic is also associated with high sustained cost. Not even experienced Biomechanical Engineers can tell a Prometheus limb from an actual one, and so visitations of specialized facilities are required for maintenance. An insurance service can be ordered to have a specialized medical professional dispatched to discretely repair the prosthetic due to emergency, or maintain the prosthetic periodically, approximately once in two months or longer. 

### X-02 Minotaurus

After much of the Prometheus' RnD was finished, replacements for military personnel that would still be willing and eligible for active service have begun to be devised. One of the first models that have been finished is Minotaurus. As the name may suggest, this is a prosthetic that is nearly opposite to Prometheus in terms of concealability, being bulky, malformed, and generally aesthetically unpleasant, but brutally strong.

It features a few other disadvantages as well; vast energy comsumption at combat load stands foremost, often requiring further implantations in back and chest to accomodate carrying an additional powerbank that makes for, despite being ergonomically shaped, a slight hunchback in most cases, making the soldier even less appealing. Some clients however take this as an opportunity to work on an intimidating visage, requesting plastic surgery to have things like eye surgeries, longer nails for claws and other beast-themed alterations done to them.

However, few have dared to argue against the benefits Minotaurus brings and lived. Legs feature up to quadruple jump heights, and with modified spinal support, vast carrying capacity, up to 360 kilograms loaded on back. Arms feature a dead lift of up to 500 kilograms, going as far as to allow handheld versions of mounted weaponry to be used commonly, with the smallest caliber that is commonly used being .950 JDJ (a real cartridge), making oversized rifles a reality. Marching load of a Minotaurus is designated at average of 180 kilograms, combat load is designated at 65 kilograms.

Minotaurus usually only sees use with the more infamous mercenaries that can afford the cost, are wicked enough to sacrifice much of their body, and are capable of accomodating the inconveniences and costs associated with extensive maintenance inherent to the prosthetic set. Very few of the Minotaurus users possess the full set, in fact, for the reasons of high cost, energy requirement, and limitations to maneuverability and operating range. The high density of EAP strands also makes it easy for electromagnetic interference to hamper the limbs' operation, being another reason to deter clients from full integration, despite comparatively low implementation cost.

### X-03 Helios

Another model originally designed to accomodate combat-ineffective soldiers, specifically designed to suit commisioned officers and commanders, as well as recon units to a small extent. Structure wise, the prosthetic is purposed to be lightweight and is certified for all-weather operation with EMC level 2 (interference or EMP disrupts operation, forcing a reboot, but sustains no permanent damage to components).

Most of the integration involves implantations to ears and augmentations of eyes and cranium, some of the prosthetics being placed in the back and chest for energy and data processing. Limbs of the Helios set are not mandatory at all, but are outfittable with a variety of sensors and native support of the VR aspect of Helios.

Helios is somewhat unusual in that much of the model's set are not actual body part replacements and augmentations, but auxilliary modules in form of helmets and parts of suits that are mostly purposed for additional sensor arrays and antennae, which is done due to load and maneuverability concerns. These modules are fairly useless to anyone not equipped with the prosthetic, and sometimes do not hamper the user significantly should they lose them or not have them available, being purposed for specialized operation.

Helios also features virtualization of the battlefield, giving the user an option to view a virtual CIC at any time, using it to coordinate their units, datalinks, information of enemy locations and composition, topographic information, and more. Sensory of Helios ranges from high-power optics and thermal imaging, through gunshot detection and medium range radar, to signal interception, decryption or jamming and laser targetfinder.

The actual capabilities of a given Helios unit depend on the outfit of the prosthetics and external modules mounted. While maintenance is relatively easy, allowing for withering harsh environmental conditions for long periods of time behind enemy lines, implementation costs and repairs are high, even among Hephaestus price range.

### X-04 Icarus

Another aspect Hephaestus decided to focus on to outfit the military were specifically recon and scout units. From that alone, it is likely needless to say this prosthetic focuses on low weight, broad operation range and period, and high speed and maneuverability. Integrity-wise, Icarus is not much more durable than regular human bodyparts. As for energy requirement, depending on user, it is actually fairly efficient, powered from nutrients the user consumes, which typically causes carrying a plenfitul supply on longer missions.

Limbs can be also further augmented to integrate a wingsuit, this has been taken as far as to develop an experimental configuration of implanting wings to facilitate a full blown flight. However, this is exceptionally rare, and even the known cases tend to be regarded as rumors, as the extensive spinal modifications mostly resulted in catastrophic failures, causing patient's death, or impairment that warranted a lenghty series of surgery and reconvalescence. The humanoid body is simply incompatible with this evolutionary feature.

Icarus can actually be configured to be so unintrusive it can be combined with other prosthetic models to a small extent, most compatible ones being the Helios and Nostos. Veteran field medics and recon specialists often make use of these combinations, should they afford the cost and the time to accustom to changes. The procedure is regarded very risky as commanding officers and medics on the field are commonly targeted. Despite the maneuverability of Icarus combined with acute awareness of Helios making for a very hard-to-kill individual, Icarus users are a prized kill, which makes for great creativity in effort of dispatching them.

### X-05 Adrasteia

After accomodating most of, if not the entire spectrum of military use with its prosthetics product range, Hephaestus moved on to applications more suiting (though not exclusively) for private applications in the mercenary realm. The first released one was Adrasteia, suited for specialists, assassins, or pilots of small spacecraft and aircraft.

Adrasteia is characteristic in that there are few characteristics to it. Mercenaries accustomed to working alone are prone to eccentricism as well as frequent tinkering and fine-tuning of their equipment, and so their requirements for prosthetics are fairly specific and diverse. It is not uncommon for a client to have their order changed, or to revisit a Hephaestus facility to have their model modified.

That is why, among other things, Adrasteia was designed to be modular to a small extent. This allows some flexibility without need of specialized personnel, and if they are available, changes may be done fairly quickly and in a broad range. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Realistic (not fully) skin coverage, resistance to screening
- Reflex boosters, adrenaline boosters (or other medicine)
- Embedded night vision, backscatter, magnification
- Embedded target acquisition for heavy craftborne/stationed weaponry or some small arms
- Special musculature to aid superb agility and acrobatic skills
- Concealed weaponry - either embedded, or deployable - daggers, small pistols, sabers, bows/crossbows and more

The specific Adrasteia unit can be composed of nearly any combination of those upgrades and is modifiable, which is of course heftily paid to Hephaestes due to repeated 'non-essential' maintenance, but the quality and leancy that Adrasteia offers seems to be worth the cost for quite a part of the more shady side of the universe.

### X-06 Ares

Ares is favoured mostly among people who favour tactics and martial arts over guns and lasers, but also among civilians. Although it may be suggested such a person may simply order a customized Adrasteia, it is very rare for this to occur. It was introduced fairly recently in the beginning of 26th century, only months apart from Nostos. Since its release, professional martial artists, military veterans, wealthy, unfortunate citizens, and even some mercenaries have their prior prosthetics removed or their limb stumps cleaned out, and replaced with the Ares unit.

Ares is actually not exactly purposed for combat in general, not as much as for absolute, complete integration into the host body. Ares is the first and one of very, very few to completely alleviate issues like possibility of rejection by the body, accustoming to using a new limb, or need of any auxilliary implantations or augments.

Ares has even managed to come so far in this regard as to possess the feature that draws many martial arts professionals, surgeons, mercenaries, and other people that rely on high-precision motor skills. Ares has the unique ability to preserve muscle memory to a large extent, requiring a brief re-learning period of about a fortnight or even less. After this, it feels entirely natural to the user subjectively, in motion, response, strength, physiology, nerve perception, and any other regard.

Of course, a superb production as this one is among the most complicated to perform on a client; the entire process of application takes approximately two months on average, and for some time the person is rendered without any prosthetic, which may pose a large issue for some. Furthermore, even though there is no maintenance cost, repair is lengthy and expensive, as is the fabrication. However, to most clients requesting Ares, having the hope of having their arm back again, to use it just like they used to, having waited for this opportunity for years, it is a small price to pay.

### X-07 Nostos

As one of the newest prosthesis, it was in development for the longest time, nearly a century, and it would not be finished without a great contribution from Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals. While primarily purposed for medical personnel, field medics have been seen using Nostos, which introduced optional light armor plating shortly after release.

A full set of Nostos prosthetics and augmentations makes for an individual that can fix most medium injuries and some heavy injuries, as well as most maladies, with nothing but their hands. The fingers and hands are equipped with advanced sensors, making for very sensitive and acute sense of touch. Much of the loadout can be altered by an educated Biomechanical Engineer, although the users mostly stick to the loadout they have chosen at purchase.

Fingers can be equipped with tools like scalpels, hyposprays, penlights, bioglue and ointment dispensers. Palms may feature integrated scanners for x-ray, EEG, and other bands that allow for immediate diagnostics, and may have a fabricator/reel for bandages. Arms further amplify the capabilities with more powerbanks, IV drip outlets, storage for splints and medication/blood samples.


Nostos augmentations to torso allow for near perpetual power supply of prosthetics through nutrients or external charging, and are also able to use those nutrients to fabricate medicine to be administered to patients. Prosthetics to torso allow for more storage. Augmentations are still relatively compact, and so allow for compatibility with some other prosthetic systems, though it is very rare to use anything but X-04 Icarus for that and is usually only done with field medics.

Even though changes to the loadout and maintenance may be done by averagely qualified personnel, if a component is actually damaged, it makes for a costly repair that must be performed by expert engineers, due to great technological complexity of Nostos that calls for expertise and high-quality components. While implementation procedure is fairly simple compared to other X-series prosthesis, it is slightly more expensive, and carries a prolonged period of adaptation due to different nature of administering aid.
