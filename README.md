# Baystation12-Lore

This is the repo for the lore. Please follow these rules when making PRs:

* Identify which section the PR will be affecting
* Identify what it is adding, changing, or removing
* Make sure that it is cleanly written and well typed, otherwise it will not be added
* Have approval from whatever Species Maintainer when changing Species lore
* Colonies **must** be approved by Lore Maintainer before they can be PR'd
* Any changes to major lore, such as Sol Gov, NanoTrasen, etc. **must* be approved by Lore Maintainer before they can be PR'd
* No colors for the love of god

That's basically it, thankyou!
