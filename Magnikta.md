## Demographics

Colonization program was mostly sponsored by German transstellars, using cheap Eastern European labour, so descendants of these two groups comprise the population.

There are two big cities, surrounded by metropolitan areas, but the rest of population lives in small settlements around the iron mines, spaced sparsely on the surface.

## Species makeup

100% Human

### Human racial/ethnic makeup

64% Polish  
21% German  
7% Serbian  
8% Slovak

## History

* 2356\. German corps, led by Hephaestos Industries, needed even more iron ore MORE iron ore, so they shipped some poor labour to this planet with some prefabs and drills. When price of iron ore dropped due to technological advances, another source of income was found - selling land to corporations for test sites and planetside research facilities.
* 2529\. Eventually an incident with an (accidental) viral leak from NT-owned facility 25 years ago triggered a classic slavic riot, which turned into typical civil war, with lots and lots of atrocities.
* 2534 After few years of fratricide, most eager rebellion leaders were taken out by mercenary strike teams hired by corps who feared nationalization. Headless rebels were eventually wiped out by the loyalist forces, and several laws restricting (mostly in name) corporate facilities were passed to appease the population.

## Politics

With memories of bloody rebellion still fresh, government is quite 'protective'. Strict ID policies, surveillance cameras in all big cities and notorious State Security Service, ran with German efficiency and Slavic ruthlessness. With focus being on terrorists and political crimes, more 'mundane' police departments are often underfunded and understaffed.

There are several movements against corporate installations, for reasons varying from red to green. Only the tamest ones are allowed to operate legally, with rest going underground, their activities ranging from hacking to holograffiti to bioterrorism to assassinations.

## Geography

Most of planet is cold, red (due to high iron content) plains. It's a bit smaller than Earth, but denser, so gravitation is almost same. Due to red color it's sometimes called 'Little Mars', but unlike actual Mars its surface is not a desert, but plains covered in reddish-brown weeds and bushes. Most rivers run underground, with lakes long their way.

Relatively small surface is urbanized, leaving a lot of space for numerous corporate testing sites and planetside research facilities. There are only two big cities:

* Labourtown, capital, holding most administrative functions and planet's only spaceport. Located near equator of the planet.
* Minendorf, where planet's iron processing industries are concentrated. Located near the biggest iron mine in the northern territories.

## Culture

They drink. A lot.

Most people who survived through the civil war bear intense hatred towards all kinds of rebels, seeing them as doom-bringing no-gooders. Younger generation is raised on those stories, but propaganda is not as thick nowdays.

Due to lack of natural lumber-producing flora, wooden furniture and goods are considered very luxurious.

## Economy

Economy is not really bustling. Iron is still an important resource, but it's getting cheaper by the day as efficiency and recycling improve. Most income comes from corp rent.
