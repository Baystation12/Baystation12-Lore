# Humans, Aliens, and Monsters Oh My!


As you may have noticed from your time on our server, Humanity is not alone in the stars. So far, there are nine other alien civilizations that we have discovered, and that's just the start of our galaxy! Who knows what else lurks in the dark corners...
Anyways, these species were already described on the previous Section in short little paragraphs that gave you a basic idea. This section is meant to give you a more comprehensive understanding of these Aliens, and perhaps prepare you to even play them!

[**Humanity**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Humanity)

One of the more prominent species in our area of the Galaxy, Humanity has certainly expanded across the stars since their first contact with the Skrell in the 25th century. Since then, they have spread out, colonized or conquered, and built for themselves a great civilization under the control of The Sol Government (or Sol Gov), based out of the heart of Human Politics, the Terran Commonwealth. Trans-Stellar Corporations push Humanity into further reaches of space, and are at the bleeding edge of new technology. In recent days, the discovery of the phoron giant in Nyx have fueled investments and jobs, bringing many Humans to the outer rim of their controlled systems, as well as many subversive organizations that have a variety of different agendas. 

[**Skrell**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/The-Skrell)

Hailing from the jungles and marshes of [Qerr'balak](https://baystation12.net/lore/Planets-and-Systems/XenoHomeworlds/Qerrbalak), Humanity's oldest ally, and one of the two most powerful known civilizations: the Skrell. They are far more technologically advanced than Humanity, and have been around this point for near 600 years, with technological advancements stagnating (though still far ahead of Humanity). They are at the top of Galactic prowess, with them being the firsrt Empire Humanity ever met in the stars. They are responsible for many advancements that Humanity has acquired, and for keeping the Peace, mostly, between the younger species. 

[**Unathi**](http://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Unathi)

a proud race of reptilians hailing from the desert planet of [Moghes](https://baystation12.net/lore/Planets-and-Systems/XenoHomeworlds/Moghes), the Unathi are a recent addition to the International Community. They are a highly sexist society, and to some, considered xenophobic too. They are very much in keeping with their own traditions and staying out of intergalactic affairs, and as such, it is rare to see them out in the stars and away from home.

[**Tajara**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/The-Tajara)

A newer addition to the galactic community from [Ahdomai](https://baystation12.net/lore/Planets-and-Systems/XenoHomeworlds/Ahdomai), the Tajara are a form of cheap labor throughout the stars, and they haven't been found to do much else. For a long time until a revolution took place they were ruled over by a class known as the "Slavemasters" and in recent years finally made it on their own into the stars, but society is still very divided for them. They're based around family, traditions, and hard work.

[**Resomii**](http://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Resomi)

The Resomii are a dimunitive race of technologically advanced, saurian-like bipeds. United, willingly or otherwise, under the banner of the Resomi Empire, the Resomii were once a powerful Interstellar Empire, but after a near apocalyptic event known as "The Fall" their society is in decline, and continues to slide further and further into dystopia and autocracy. Many Resomii escape from the totalitarian government and into the lands of Humanity and the Skrell as refugees.

[**Dionaea**](http://baystation12.net/lore/Species/The-Dionaea)

Commonly referred to (erroneously) as 'plant people', the Dionaea are a strange space-dwelling collective species hailing from Epsilon Ursae Minoris. Each 'diona' is a cluster of numerous cat-sized organisms called nymphs; there is no effective upper limit to the number that can fuse in gestalt, and reports exist of the Epsilon Ursae Minoris primary being ringed with a cloud of singing space-station-sized entities.

The Dionaea coexist peacefully with all known species, especially the Skrell. Their communal mind makes them slow to react, and they have difficulty understanding even the simplest concepts of other minds. Their alien physiology allows them survive happily off a diet of nothing but light, water and other radiation.

[**Giant armoured serpentids**](http://baystation12.net/lore/Species/GAS)

With such a long name, giant armoured serpentids are often written as GAS for short and are sometimes informally called "nabbers". 

Standing at a terrifying nine feet above the ground, these massive creatures look like some nightmarish hybrid of a snake, millipede, and praying mantis. Their discovery has only recently been released to the public as part of a long-term project to teach them how to work with humans. Will the project be successful? Only time will tell.

## That's Only Six Aliens

As you can imagine, not every species gets along, and those who don't get along with everyone else are known as the Vox, and the Moraki. The Vox are relatable to Somali pirates in the 21st century when it comes to Human Policy. There is open conflict against the ones that attack our vessels, but overall no war has been declared as they are not a unified civilization. The Moraki are in open war against the Positronic Union, Sol Gov, and the Skrell at the current time, and have been invading the Union in all out War. 


[**Vox**](http://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Vox)

The Vox were once a large star-faring civilization that were extremely advanced for their time, according to the Vox, at least. It is said that they unlocked the very code of life itself, forming it, and shaping it to their very will. So says the Vox, at least. The Vox also say they know the secrets of the universe and will sell it to you for the low, low price of twenty thalers. Its unfortunate, but you can’t put much stock into Vox history. It is in a constant state of flux, changing at will to suit a crafty Vox merchant or a prideful Vox scavenger. Whatever their history is, it must be long as they’ve been in space as long as recorded history cares to remember them.

[**Moraki**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Moraki)

The Moraki Imperiate is a vast empire far "North" of Known Space that recently made contact with the known species with a grand invasion of the Positronic Union, and assaults in both Skrell Space and Sol Gov. To the common man, not much is known, but they are a omnicidal, highly theocratic species that think other species are a scourge on the Universe, and they are there to destroy them or enslave them. Eugenics is probably the best thing ever to them. They also have a subspecies that has been genetically engineered into slavery. They breath Chlorine, and they hate everyone.

## Anything Else?

[**The IPC**](http://baystation12.net/lore/Species/The-IPCs)

Positronic intelligence really took off in the 26th century, and it is not uncommon to see independant, free-willed robots on many human stations, particularly in fringe systems where standards are slightly lax and public opinion less relevant to corporate operations. IPCs (Integrated Positronic Chassis) are a loose category of self-willed robots with a humanoid form, generally self-owned after being 'born' into servitude; they are reliable and dedicated workers, albeit more than slightly inhuman in outlook and perspective.

**Vat Born**

With cloning on the forefront of human scientific advancement, cheap mass production of bodies is a very real and rather ethically grey industry. Vat-grown humans tend to be paler than baseline, with no appendix and fewer inherited genetic disabilities, but a weakened metabolism. From this baseline version, there are two other variants. 

**Grav-Adapted Humans** 

Heavier and stronger than a baseline human, gravity-adapted people have thick radiation-resistant skin with a high lead content, denser bones, and recessed eyes beneath a prominent brow in order to shield them from the glare of a dangerously bright, alien sun. This comes at the cost of mobility, flexibility, and increased oxygen requirements to support their robust metabolism.

**Space-Adapted Humans**

Lithe and frail, these sickly folk were engineered for work in environments that lack both light and atmosphere. As such, they're quite resistant to asphyxiation as well as toxins, but they suffer from weakened bone structure and a marked vulnerability to bright lights.
