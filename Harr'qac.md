## History

Skrell first found this planet about year 2300 on their research flight. They found a smaller planet with developed life. They first tried sending signals towards the planet, but when they got no response, they used their large-scale scanners and surveillance drones to search for any intelligent lifeform activity, like cities or industry. When they found nothing, they decided to colonise the planet, as it resembled Qerr'Balak.

## Geography

![Map][2]

*The map is somewhat illustrative.*

The planet consists of 40% ocean, but small lakes are very common, and planet itself seems nearly as humid as Qerrbalak. Some of surface consists of swamps and jungles, but most is more like temperate forests or grasslands, which are more humid, rainy, and generally contain more water. There are three main continents. Between the three, there is an ocean called Kor'xil, in which quite large island Korm exists.

### Flora and fauna

There are trees, simillar to Earth broadleaf forests, but their leaves are larger as they contain lots of water. Fungi are common too, sometimes growing to sizes of 3 metres. From animals, there are large mammals, called Friaq by Skrell, who feed on those large mushrooms, and therefore they only live in areas populated by them.

Another unusual kind are the Xolm, microscopic organisms that are considered animals. They make a network of thin threads, which are however very strong. The networks are made of individual Xolm, who together behave as one larger animal. They are too small to be seen only by eye, but they move in the water, taking it with them. From outside, it seems like the part of water they live in was moving by itself. They usually make sphere-like networks. On one side, there are less threads and they can split at any time, forming a mouth-like hole. Using this, they swallow small animals or plants and then, when "mouth" is closed, they poison their victim and disassemble (digest) his body. They are often seen as balls of water, sometimes with a smaller fish, a leaf or something larger inside.

Space carp migrations happen once in a few years and carps sometimes find their way to the planet.

## Skrellian society

Caste system is very important for Skrell of this planet. However, it works slightly different than on Qerr'Balak and colonies close to it. Most importantly, a Skrell from Harr'qac can decide to switch to another caste of his preference. This is not always the case, as the castes act as subcultures specialized to certain tasks and values, and as such, the children are raised in the mindset of the particular caste. However, sometimes a young Skrell has views that are diamertrically different from his caste and because of this feels like he/she does not belong into the caste. In this case, he/she can formally switch his caste. This is however not done that often, due to the freedom offered by the caste system itself.

Because of the bondings where at least one of the Skrell switched his/her caste, and the switching itself, it may be harder to tell a particular Skrell's caste just by his/her skin color in some families and you also need to notice their clothing and other specifics.

### Family life

Family life on Harr'qac is similliar to the one on Qerr'Balak. Harr'qacian Skrell tend to bond fewer times in life. In some families, there is a recent tendency to put Qrri'Baqa into more contact with each other to strenghten their familial relations.

## Cities

Harr'qaci Skrell have built cities, that, unlike on Qerrbalak, are not standing on stilts, but instead are directly on the ground. The cities are inside very solid glass spheres.

There are also some caste-specific cities, like military bases for Raskinta-Katish, large research centers for Malish-Katish or great Garden-cities for Talum-Katish. There is however no restricted access. Everyone can come to any of these for various reasons. The point is that the same way Skrell are divided into castes that focus on certain part of life of the society, some cities also focus on certain tasks. These are usually closer to other city-states and are supported and influenced by them.

#### Notable cities

* **Qrri'Mal**  
  The academy of Qrri'Mal is widely known for its research endeavours, which mainly aim into space. This makes Qrri'Mal highly attractive for researchers. The city-state is currently funding the construction of a nearby large research facility.
* **Skrriol**  
  Known for the abundance of natural resources near the city, much of the material used on Harr'qac comes from Skrriol. This includes materials from both, above and below the ground.
* **Vulx'Fi**  
  One of the first colonised place on the planet. It is widely known for its beautiful landscapes and is a major tourist spot. Giant fungi and Friaq live more densely around this city.
* **Kaux-Nira**  
  Situated on a small island, it is a major trading port.
* **Gor-Lo**  
  A famous Talum-Katish Garden-city. About 60% of the population are Talum-Katish. Another major tourist destination. Apart from the gardens, there are multiple museums, theaters and other cultural localities in or near the city. It is said that even Qerr-Katish from nearby systems travel to Harr'qac just to visit Gor-Lo. Life in the city is slow-paced and calm.
* **Nqli**  
  Another famous scientific spot, Nqli academy researchers are most known for their work in the fields of genetics and neurology. There is a notable giant fungi concentration around the city and some scientists focus on their use as a food source.
* **Scri'x**  
  The wide plains of Scri'x were the first colonised area of Harr'qac. Today, Scri'x operates an important spaceport. One of the first ships to land on Harr'qac is standing in the city centre.
* **Qal-Si**  
  Located on a cliff. This city is known for many trading companies that originate from here, however, also for its higher than average amount of organized criminality. 
* **Rel-Ma'xie**  
  Known for being the largest Harr'qaci city, as there are plenty of resources nearby and the city's quality of life is considered quite high. There are farms around the city to support it and also many other city-states with food.
* **University of Harr'qac**  

### Living

Harr'qaci Skrell often build circular houses, which often have many entrances around the ground floor. Usual living house for one family has 4 floors, the ground floor being entrance (since doors are at least on four sides), which can be also used for less private meetings, celebrations and stuff. First floor usually houses kitchen, living room and toilet. Second floor contains private rooms or offices and usually a toilet too. Third floor is mostly the same as second, but less usually has a toilet. In he middle of each floor, there is either an elevator or a staircase. On the top of houses, there are balconies, in which in some cases Skrell have little gardens. There's also a new trend currently, to build narrow metal bridges between balconies of houses with simillar height, if the inhabitants like each other.

## Government

Similliarly to Qerr'Balak, there are many city-states governing themselves. However, when colonising the planet, Skrell chose to try a similliar yet new form of government. City-states on each continent are grouped together. Qerr-Skria of these city-states elect a representative of their continent, called Qerr. This way, cities manage themselves, they decide about continent-wide things together and are represented by one Skrell for each continent when discussing global decisions. The three Qerrs meet in Government District of the University of Harr'qac.

## Education

The most famous academy of Harr'qac is The University of Harr'qac. It's not located any any city, but it rather creates a city like any other itself. It's located on the island of Korm. The university takes almost whole island, with lots of parks, services, leisure areas... It is supported by other cities, as the global government meets there.

Same as on Qerrbalak, each city state also has its own academy.

## Economy

Harr'qac is considered quite rich colony, with very good general living standard.

### Food and water

Water is not an issue on a world like Harr'qac. It is easily accessible and most city-states are able to provide clean water to their citizens by themselves.

Food is produced by variety of city-states, some of them large, such as Re-Ma'xie which exports food to city-states on every continent; some smaller, sustaining themselves and just one or two nearby city-states.

### Natural resources

Harr'qaci Skrell enjoy the abundance of many materials required for advanced industry and science. There are also jungles and forests, however several city-states have restricted woodcutting due to environmental reasons, therefore wood is more luxurious there and is imported from other city-states but also from other colonies.

### Research

Joint projects.

### Tourism
