#So You Want to Go Corporate?

Everything you'll encounter out in the Nyx System will probably have a label on it, from either NanoTrasen, Githari Exports, Hesphaistos Industries, one of the other Trans-Stellar Corporations, or even the Free Trade Union- Marketing is everywhere. That is why you should know your ways around their inner workings, and what they're about.

##The Big Seven

There are Seven Trans-Stellar Corporations that really shape what happens in the Outer Rims of space, and control markets of goods throughout the stars. These seven TSCs are NanoTrasen, Ward-Takahashi GMB, Githari Exports, Grayson Manufactories Ltd., Aether Atmospherics and Recycling, Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals, and Hesphaistos Industries. These are the wealthiest, most powerful, greedy, and controlling TSCs currently in existance. 

- [**NanoTrasen**](https://baystation12.net/lore/NanoTrasen)

A high-tech research company with a majority holding on phoron claims in the Nyx system and throughout the galaxy.

- [**Ward-Takahashi GMB**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Ward-Takahashi-GMB)

A manufacturing company that produces everything from consumer electronics, like PDAs and laptop computers, to home appliances and other miscellaneous items.

- [**Githari Exports**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Githari-Exports)

A large producer of luxury and alcoholic goods based out of their headquarters on Mars.

- [**Grayson Manufactories Ltd.**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Grayson-Manufactories-Ltd.)

A mining company that serves as one of the largest providers of raw materials in known space. Recently, it has also begun to sell generic assembly materials for use in construction projects (metal beams, lattice, coils, etc.)

- [**Aether Atmospherics and Recycling**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Aether-Atmospherics-and-Recycling)

An atmospherics and recycling company based in the Sol system.


- [**Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Zeng-Hu-Pharmaceuticals)

A pharmaceutical company renown for its recent advancements in medicine and questionable business practices.

- [**Hesphaistos Industries**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Hesphaistos-Industries)

A renown arms manufacturing and general security equipment company. Commonly known as the first trans-stellar to develop after the formation of Sol Central.

##Smaller Corporations

### Trans-Stellar Corporations

- **Kappa Communications**

Established to capitalize on the invention of Quantum Entanglement communications technology. Even before humanity expanded into the stars, it was clear communication needed to keep up with advances in spacetravel. After attempts at communications linked to light became inadequate, research into Quantum Entanglement allowed binary communication at a theoretically infinite distance. Kappa began constructing a communications network in Sol, and as humanity spread, so did its communications.
Kappa is one of the less known Trans-Stellar Corporations. While it doesn't sell some of the flashier technology on the market, most of Kappa's contributions are behind the scenes. While you might have a trendy service provider for intergalactic communications, it's almost guaranteed to pass through communications beacons built by Kappa. Currently, the cheapest, most ubiquitous Kappa product is the Quantum Entanglement fax.

### Megacorporations

- **Slate Sisters Shipbuilding and Engineering**

Founded in the period of early colonial exploration by sisters Laura and Elizabeth to meet the rising demand for commercial vessels. No longer owned by descendants of the Slate family, however a distant grandson of Elizabeth Slate currently sits on the board of directors.
Headquartered in Alpha Centauri, largely among the system's inner asteroid belt. While originally all manufacturing was done in Alpha Centauri, Triple-S manufacturing facilities can now be found spread throughout human space. The Slate MO is to strip a hollow asteroid, and refit it as a large natural hangar, shielded from the elements.
While Slate lags behind other TSCs in diversity of business, asset protection, and workforce size, it understandably has the largest fleet of any Trans-Stellar, save possibly NanoTrasen.
The Slate Sisters' catalogue is primarily made up of commercial and industrial spacefaring vessels. Most bulk carriers, tankers, container transports, and mining rigs are Slate-built or based off of one of their designs. They also run a popular line of Colonial Landers, designed to be dismantled upon arrival on a new world, as well as a variety of shuttles and ballistic drop-pods for cheap orbital supply.

- **Haakon Group**

Originally a prospecting firm founded in the early days of exploration in the Sol System. Haakon Group quickly found it was more profitable to sell ships to the explorers than to explore themselves, and eked out a niche as a specialist shipbuilder. What skyrocketed Haakon Group to greatness was the formation of Sol Centralized Governing Body, and its eventual expansion. Haakon Group won the first SolGov contract to build military and civil ships for the exploration of other star systems, earning a reputation for building reliable spacecraft that will keep running even after losing half of its thrusters and reactor shielding.
Today, almost all of Haakon Group's dockyards and manufacturing facilities are based around Saturn, built into smaller moons, or orbiting the larger ones. Instead of expanding as some of its competitors have done, confident that its government and colonial contracts will continue for the foreseeable future, Haakon has instead built up its existing facilities. Multiple environmental groups have criticized Haakon for using several Moons and Moonlets as testing ranges for shipboard weapon systems, and for the damage done to Saturn's rings by frequent shipping traffic, no motion regulating Haakon Group has passed either Assembly as of yet.
There are rumors that Haakon has constructed a secret facility somewhere in or past the Kuiper Belt, possibly hidden by electromagnetic asteroids, or experimental stealth tech, and operates a Skunkworks program outside the watchful eyes of its rivals. These rumors have never been substantiated however, and Haakon's only official statement on the matter is, "We have no statement at this time."
Haakon Group's most popular products are its larger military vessels. Corvettes, Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers, Carriers, Battlecruisers and Dreadnoughts, all are produced by Haakon and sold to SolGov and larger colonies. Most of these craft are not available to non-government operators, however some TSCs have had legal exceptions made for them. While Haakon also produces strike craft, bombers, gunships, and patrol craft, it's often said they don't have the same touch for smaller vehicles. On the civilian market, Haakon produces dependable, if expensive, scout craft and couriers, as well as some disarmed versions of its other products.

- **O'Neill Manufacturing**

A colonial start-up, O'Niell Manufacturing meets the demands of a growing community of spacers looking for more out of their EVA suits. Space suits have been an essential part of space exploration, for obvious reasons. Over time, suits have improved from the clunky affairs of early space travel, and O'Niell can provide any kind of suit for any kind of job. Voidsuits are their most common product, though some Softsuits are still sold for emergency use. Recently though, O'Niell has released a line of affordable industrial hardsuits to complement their line of exosuits. While many of their products are considered middle of the line goods, operators of O'Niell's line of equipment swear by its reliability

- **Falco Designs**

A younger corporation, the simply named Falco Designs first came onto the radar in the early 2500s. Its founder Giuseppe Cecilio, at the time a minor Billionaire, purchased the entirety of the asteroid Ceres. Ceres had originally been a stepping stone for the exploration of Sol, though by the 26th century it had been long defunct, stripped of resources and populated by those whose grandparents' grandparents hadn't had the money to leave. Cecilio however, saw opportunity in those people. He paid the indigenous population to refit Ceres as a large manufacturing facility, and began producing luxury spacecraft. Cruise liners, yachts, and high class couriers filled a market for executive space travel that hadn't been largely exploited at that time. Capitalizing on the positive attention his company received for employing and uplifting a hereditary lower class, Cecilio made Falco into the name in luxury spacecraft. If you somehow find yourself a passenger aboard a spacecraft made by Falco, it's likely you've made it to a level of success most people will never even dream of.

- **Major Bill's Transportation and Shipping**

While hauling freight may not be the most romantic career in modern times, Major Bill's Shipping is partly responsible for the rapid growth of inter-colonial commerce. Employing a massive fleet of freighters, tankers, and haulers, Major Bill's operates in the majority of human space. While many TSCs employ their own shipping, corporations like Major Bill's connect the many colonies, unaffiliated habitats, and settlements across the known galaxy. Lately however, the expansion of trade into areas outside of SolGov has necessitated the hiring of security contractors to maintain the safety of trade vessels, and the integrity of their cargo.

### Minor Corporations

- **Petrovitch Spacecraft**

Primarily a military spacecraft contractor, Petrovitch is known for its strike craft, fighters, bombers, interceptors, electronic warfare craft, gunships, dropships, and recon craft. Their largest vessels approach Corvette sizes, though typically are designed for crews smaller than 50. A Petrovitch strike craft on sensors is generally the sign that the party is over.

- **Aussec Armory**

A minor name alongside weapons manufacturers like Hephaestus(that's right, I spelled it correctly) and NanoTrasen, Aussec Armory is nevertheless a well known name in firearms. Continuing to produce ballistics instead of energy weaponry, Aussec is seen by some to be behind the times, but many mercenary and private security firms swear by, and kill with, Aussec arms.

- **Vu-Cheong**

A minor player in the spacecraft industry, Vu-Cheong is not a common household name. However, TSCs, Governments, and Explorers alike all know Vu-Cheong's reputation for high-quality scientific spacecraft, worth their exorbitant prices. Often ungainly looking, the research vessels produced by Vu-Cheong at their private manufacturing facility are rivaled by none, and are typically only seen in the hands of governments, wealthy research firms, or TSCs that admit their own shipbuilding facilities aren't up to the task.

- **Walton Industries**

Formerly possessing Megacorporation status, the Earth-based Walton Industries manufactured cheap consumer goods using impoverished labor on Earth, however industrial growth and new advances in automation technology in the 25th century made it far cheaper to produce goods among the colonies, than to import them from Sol. With the successes of corporations such as Ward-Takahashi, Walton Industries has fallen on hard times, and is looking to readjust their business model in order to stay afloat.

- **Phoenix Foundries**

While it might not make it to the headlines, Phoenix Foundries is a necessary provider of low to medium-end planetary and orbital vehicles. Many cheap shuttles and interplanetary couriers were churned out at one of Phoenix's many automated plants, as well as an almost endless line of terrestrial crawlers, speeders, and exosuits. Recently, Phoenix has been looking at upsizing and trying to break into the larger vessel market, though only time will tell if it succeeds.

- **SaniCorp**

Relatively underwhelming compared to medical giants such as Vey-Med, SaniCorp's products are largely behind the scenes medical gear. Many sanitation sprayers, gauze, sterile gloves, and autoinjector casings are made by SaniCorp. There is one notable exception to their somewhat pedestrian medical offerings, their prosthetics. While not offering as many flashy options as some augments, SaniCorp offers a range of comfortable, easy to maintain, clean, and operate prosthetic limb replacements and augmentations.

##The Free Trade Union

The Free Trade Union is different from other tran-stellars in that they are not just a company, but they are a big conglomerate of various traders and merchants from all over the galaxy. They control a sizable fleet of vessels of various sizes which are given autonomy from the central command to engage in trading. They also host a fleet of combat vessels which respond directly to the central command for defending traders when necessary. They are in control of many large scale trade stations across the known galaxy, even in non-human space. Generally, they are multi-purpose stations but they always keep areas filled with duty-free shops. Almost anything is sold there and products that are forbidden or have insanely high taxes in other places are generally sold in the duty-free shops at very cheap and low prices.
They are the creators of the Tradeband language, created specially for being a lingua franca where every merchant can understand each other independent of language or nationality.
