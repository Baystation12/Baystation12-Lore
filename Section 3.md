That is why you should know your ways around their inner workings, and what they're about.

##The Free Trade Union

The Free Trade Union is different from other tran-stellars in that they are not just a company, but they are a big conglomerate of various traders and merchants from all over the galaxy. They control a sizable fleet of vessels of various sizes which are given autonomy from the central command to engage in trading. They also host a fleet of combat vessels which respond directly to the central command for defending traders when necessary. They are in control of many large scale trade stations across the known galaxy, even in non-human space. Generally, they are multi-purpose stations but they always keep areas filled with duty-free shops. Almost anything is sold there and products that are forbidden or have insanely high taxes in other places are generally sold in the duty-free shops at very cheap and low prices.
They are the creators of the Tradeband language, created specially for being a lingua franca where every merchant can understand each other independent of language or nationality.
