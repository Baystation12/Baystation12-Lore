#So You Want to Go Corporate?

Everything you'll encounter out in the Nyx System will probably have a label on it, from either NanoTrasen, Githari Exports, Hesphaistos Industries, one of the other Trans-Stellar Corporations, or even the Free Trade Union; marketing is everywhere. That is why you should know your ways around their inner workings, and what they're about.

##The Big Seven

There are Seven Trans-Stellar Corporations that really shape what happens in the Outer Rims of space, and control markets of goods throughout the stars. These are the wealthiest, most powerful, greedy, and controlling TSCs currently in existance. 

- [**NanoTrasen**](https://baystation12.net/lore/NanoTrasen)

A high-tech research company with a majority holding on phoron claims in the Nyx system and throughout the galaxy.

- [**Ward-Takahashi GMB**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Ward-Takahashi-GMB)

A manufacturing company that produces everything from consumer electronics, like PDAs and laptop computers, to home appliances and other miscellaneous items.

- [**Githari Exports**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Githari-Exports)

A large producer of luxury and alcoholic goods based out of their headquarters on Mars.

- [**Grayson Manufactories Ltd.**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Grayson-Manufactories-Ltd.)

A mining company that serves as one of the largest providers of raw materials in known space. Recently, it has also begun to sell generic assembly materials for use in construction projects (metal beams, lattice, coils, etc.)

- [**Aether Atmospherics and Recycling**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Aether-Atmospherics-and-Recycling)

An atmospherics and recycling company based in the Sol system.


- [**Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Zeng-Hu-Pharmaceuticals)

A pharmaceutical company renown for its recent advancements in medicine and questionable business practices.

- [**Hephaestus Industries**](https://baystation12.net/lore/Hesphaistos-Industries)

A renown arms manufacturing and general security equipment company. Commonly known as the first trans-stellar to develop after the formation of Sol Central.

##Smaller Corporations

### Trans-Stellar Corporations

- **Kappa Communications**

Established to capitalize on the invention of Quantum Entanglement communications technology. Even before humanity expanded into the stars, it was clear communication needed to keep up with advances in spacetravel. After attempts at communications linked to light became inadequate, research into Quantum Entanglement allowed binary communication at a theoretically infinite distance. Kappa began constructing a communications network in Sol, and as humanity spread, so did its communications.

Kappa is one of the less known Trans-Stellar Corporations. While it doesn't sell some of the flashiest technology on the market, most of Kappa's contributions are behind the scenes. While you might have a trendy service provider for intergalactic communications, it's almost guaranteed to pass through communications beacons built by Kappa. Currently, the cheapest, most ubiquitous Kappa product is the Quantum Entanglement fax.

### Megacorporations

- **Slate Sisters Shipbuilding and Engineering**

Founded in the period of early colonial exploration by sisters Laura and Elizabeth Slate to meet the rising demand for commercial vessels, it is also known as Triple-S. It is no longer owned by descendants of the Slate family, however a distant grandson of Elizabeth Slate currently sits in the board of directors.

Headquartered in Alpha Centauri, largely among the system's inner asteroid belt, all manufacturing was done in there before spreadinging out throughout human space. The Slate's Modus Operandi is to strip a hollow asteroid, and refit it as a large natural hangar, shielded from the elements. While Slate lags behind other TSCs in diversity of business, asset protection, and workforce size, it understandably has the largest fleet of any Trans-Stellar, save possibly NanoTrasen.

The Slate Sisters' catalogue is primarily made up of commercial and industrial spacefaring vessels. Most bulk carriers, tankers, container transports, and mining rigs are Slate-built or based off of one of their designs. They also run a popular line of Colonial Landers, designed to be dismantled upon arrival on a new world, as well as a variety of shuttles and ballistic drop-pods for cheap orbital supply.

- **Haakon Group**

Originally a prospecting firm founded in the early days of exploration in the Sol System. Haakon Group quickly found it was more profitable to sell ships to the explorers than to explore themselves, and eked out a niche as a specialist shipbuilder. What skyrocketed Haakon Group to greatness was the formation of Sol Centralized Governing Body, and its eventual expansion. Haakon Group won the first SolGov contract to build military and civil ships for the exploration of other star systems, earning a reputation for building reliable spacecraft that will keep running even after losing half of its thrusters and reactor shielding.

Today, almost all of Haakon Group's dockyards and manufacturing facilities are based around Saturn, built into smaller moons, or orbiting the larger ones. Instead of expanding as some of its competitors have done, confident that its government and colonial contracts will continue for the foreseeable future, Haakon has instead built up its existing facilities. Multiple environmental groups have criticized Haakon for using several Moons and Moonlets as testing ranges for shipboard weapon systems, and for the damage done to Saturn's rings by frequent shipping traffic, no motion regulating Haakon Group has passed either Assembly as of yet.

There are rumors that Haakon has constructed a secret facility somewhere in or past the Kuiper Belt, possibly hidden by electromagnetic asteroids, or experimental stealth tech, and operates a Skunkworks program outside the watchful eyes of its rivals. These rumors have never been substantiated however, and Haakon's only official statement on the matter is, "We have no statement at this time."

Haakon Group's most popular products are its larger military vessels. Corvettes, Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers, Carriers, Battlecruisers and Dreadnoughts, all are produced by Haakon and sold to SolGov and larger colonies. Most of these craft are not available to non-government operators, however some TSCs have had legal exceptions made for them. While Haakon also produces strike craft, bombers, gunships, and patrol craft, it's often said they don't have the same touch for smaller vehicles. On the civilian market, Haakon produces dependable, if expensive, scout craft and couriers, as well as some disarmed versions of its other products.

- **O'Neill Manufacturing**

A colonial start-up, O'Niell Manufacturing meets the demands of a growing community of spacers looking for more out of their EVA suits. Space suits have been an essential part of space exploration, for obvious reasons. Over time, suits have improved from the clunky affairs of early space travel, and O'Niell can provide any kind of suit for any kind of job. Voidsuits are their most common product, though some Softsuits are still sold for emergency use. Recently though, O'Niell has released a line of affordable industrial hardsuits to complement their line of exosuits. While many of their products are considered middle of the line goods, operators of O'Niell's line of equipment swear by its reliability.

- **Falco Designs**

A younger corporation, the simply named Falco Designs first came onto the radar in the early 2500s. Its founder Giuseppe Cecilio, at the time a minor billionaire, purchased the entirety of the asteroid Ceres. Ceres had originally been a stepping stone for the exploration of Sol, though by the 26th century it had been long defunct, stripped of resources and populated by those whose grandparents' grandparents hadn't had the money to leave. Cecilio however, saw opportunity in those people. He paid the indigenous population to refit Ceres as a large manufacturing facility, and began producing luxury spacecraft. Cruise liners, yachts, and high class couriers filled a market for executive space travel that hadn't been largely exploited at that time. Capitalizing on the positive attention his company received for employing and uplifting a hereditary lower class, Cecilio made Falco into the name in luxury spacecraft. If you somehow find yourself a passenger aboard a spacecraft made by Falco, it's likely you've made it to a level of success most people will never even dream of.

- **Major Bill's Transportation and Shipping**

While hauling freight may not be the most romantic career in modern times, Major Bill's Shipping is partly responsible for the rapid growth of inter-colonial commerce. Employing a massive fleet of freighters, tankers, and haulers, Major Bill's operates in the majority of human space. While many TSCs employ their own shipping, corporations like Major Bill's connect the many colonies, unaffiliated habitats, and settlements across the known galaxy. Lately however, the expansion of trade into areas outside of SolGov has necessitated the hiring of security contractors to maintain the safety of trade vessels, and the integrity of their cargo.

- **Focal Point Energestics**

Created from a fusion of energy companies as well as Electrical Engineering companies, like General Electric, E.ON, RWE, Petronas, Å koda Works, and even most of EPPSA (European Power Plant Supplier Association), this company is considered a Megacorporation. It focuses, as its composure suggests, on providing a unified solution for resources and engineering for a fully integrated power grid, even on a planetary scale.

While it does not yet possess technologies like Gravitational Singularity reactor or Supermatter reactor (which is exclusive to NanoTrasen at this time), it finds no match in producing other devices and components of a proper working power grid, like underground shielded long-range transmission wiring, high-efficiency transformers (up to 99.8%), and superior gas turbines and TEGs. They are designers of PSU racks, and later the SMES.

While usually the larger corporations devise their own power grid and manage their own planets, moons, orstations, FPE is often consulted and hired when a less than usual approach needs to be taken, and their products are on high demand.


### Minor Corporations

- **Petrovitch Spacecraft**

Primarily a military spacecraft contractor, Petrovitch is known for its strike craft, fighters, bombers, interceptors, electronic warfare craft, gunships, dropships, and recon craft. Their largest vessels approach Corvette sizes, though typically are designed for crews smaller than 50. A Petrovitch strike craft on sensors is generally the sign that the party is over.

- **Aussec Armory**

A minor name alongside weapons manufacturers like Hephaestus and NanoTrasen, Aussec Armory is nevertheless a well known name in firearms. Continuing to produce ballistics instead of energy weaponry, Aussec is seen by some to be behind the times, but many mercenary and private security firms swear by, and kill with, Aussec arms.

- **Vu-Cheong**

A minor player in the spacecraft industry, Vu-Cheong is not a common household name. However, TSCs, Governments, and Explorers alike all know Vu-Cheong's reputation for high-quality scientific spacecraft, worth their exorbitant prices. Often ungainly looking, the research vessels produced by Vu-Cheong at their private manufacturing facility are rivaled by none, and are typically only seen in the hands of governments, wealthy research firms, or TSCs that admit their own shipbuilding facilities aren't up to the task.

- **Walton Industries**

Formerly possessing Megacorporation status, the Earth-based Walton Industries manufactured cheap consumer goods using impoverished labor on Earth, however industrial growth and new advances in automation technology in the 25th century made it far cheaper to produce goods among the colonies, than to import them from Sol. With the successes of corporations such as Ward-Takahashi, Walton Industries has fallen on hard times, and is looking to readjust their business model in order to stay afloat.

- **Phoenix Foundries**

While it might not make it to the headlines, Phoenix Foundries is a necessary provider of low to medium-end planetary and orbital vehicles. Many cheap shuttles and interplanetary couriers were churned out at one of Phoenix's many automated plants, as well as an almost endless line of terrestrial crawlers, speeders, and exosuits. Recently, Phoenix has been looking at upsizing and trying to break into the larger vessel market, though only time will tell if it succeeds.

- **Sterling Manufactures**

A small company founded on the brink of 22nd century by a group of Commonwealth privateers, it focuses on the utmost of luxury goods, with specialty on manual production and only using technologies from 20th or 21st century. With a focus on perfection and quality through distinctive cratfsmanship, and goods ranging from fine liquours through cigars to furniture and cloths, prices are at the highest when dealing with this company. Given its very limited production volume, Sterling features exorbitant profit margins, yet very low revenue compared to Megacorporations or greater businesses, and regardless of high demand for its products, sits among the smallest corporations.

- **SaniCorp**

Relatively underwhelming compared to medical giants such as Vey-Med, SaniCorp's products are largely behind-the-scenes medical gear. Many sanitation sprayers, gauze, sterile gloves, and autoinjector casings are made by SaniCorp. There is one notable exception to their somewhat pedestrian medical offerings, their prosthetics. While not offering as many flashy options as some augments, SaniCorp offers a range of comfortable, easy to maintain, clean, and operate prosthetic limb replacements and augmentations.

- **Mars Security Industries (M.S.I)**

Founded during the first colonisation of Mars, M.S.I. intended to take advantage of the rich metal deposits to make cheap, mass produced small arms. When the colonies on Mars became more developed, they opened factories to reduce costs by producing the arms locally. To this day, M.S.I. produces some of the cheapest ballistic weapons to be found in the Sol system.

- **SAARE (Stealth Assault, Accrual and Reconnaissance Enterprise)**

SAARE is a very recently instated PMC company that has been founded by a number of Hephaestus Dedicated Explorer regimen members. Composed from dropouts or veterans from armies of various governments and security forces, it is a multi-racial corporation much more so than most other companies claim. The company seeks out soldiers with a specific skillset, specializing on Black Ops for their clients, missions silent and loud, as well as utilizing presently unorthodox tactics like Guerrila Warfare, where a handful of SAARE operatives can disrupt operations of an expansive security force.

SAARE's services are relatively expensive and have seen little action as a corporation, and given their very recent establishment and investment, it shall take time before its margins and revenue rise it up the ranks of corporations, however demand is slowly rising for SAARE to perform operations around Sol, as well as Nyx, for different corporations.

##The Free Trade Union

The Free Trade Union is different from other trans-stellars in that they are not just a company, but a big conglomerate of various traders and merchants from all over the galaxy. They control a sizable fleet of vessels of various sizes which are given autonomy from the central command to engage in trading. They also host a fleet of combat vessels which respond directly to the central command for defending traders when necessary. They are in control of many large scale trade stations across the known galaxy, even in non-human space. Generally, they are multi-purpose stations but they always keep areas filled with duty-free shops. Almost anything is sold there and products that are forbidden or have insanely high taxes in other places are generally sold in the duty-free shops at very cheap and low prices.
They are the creators of the Tradeband language, created specially for being a lingua franca where every merchant can understand each other independent of language or nationality.

##Other Notable Corporations

- **Empire of Sirisai Ministry of Foreign Affairs**

While not a corporation in its own right, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs handles all the trade economical factors on an interstellar scale for the Empire of Sirisai. Formed thousands of years ago by Rameriti, it is a hulking beast of a ministry that, even today, shows extreme competence, despite its overbloated mass. Due to the palace economy of the Empire of Sirisai, no 'true' interstellar corporations exist in the Empire, and instead all production is done by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs takes these resources, and exports them to various markets. In this case, it essentially acts as a Resomi corporation would, except that it is every corporation that could be rolled into one.

It began trading with humanity back soon after the first contact even with the Skrell, providing small medical imports to humanity here and there. Only recently within the few hundred years has it opened the floodgates. Due to the advanced technology available in the empire -- life extension is a commodity not to be taken lightly, even in the face of cloning -- it has began making incredible waves in markets traditionally dominated by the Free Trade Union. Providing both preassembled technology bits to simply reliable, cheap, and mass produced basic materials such as bolts and screws, many corporations have come to rely upon the Empire of Sirisai for their pure manufacturing ability.

In return, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs imports an incredible amount of raw materials, being any mining corporation's best friend. They currently have an exclusive deal for phoron with Nanotrasen. Not only that, but Nanotrasen is one of the largest non-Resomi employers for Resomi workers, working closely with the Ministry to form employment contracts and trade agreements.

- **Inuvaios Eclestra**

A company more commonly known with its GalCom translation as Eclipse Innovations, or simply as Eclestra, the communication in Tradeband is so common there that it influenced its official name. When the human relations with other races improved, joint research efforts as well as collaborations in other industries began. Eclestra is one of the lasting initiatives, despite presence of giants in RnD like NanoTrasen, as well as relative self-sufficiency of other TSCs/megacorps in that regard, and accepts scientists and researchers regardless of race, gender, religion and all those things that could possibly make someone discriminate someone.

Currently, the racial composition of Eclestra is:

- 27% Tajara
- 38% Human
- 8% Resomi
- 17% Skrell
- 10% Dionaea

Economy analysts suggest few reasons for the company's sustained operation. Smaller corporations usually cannot afford developing their own technology by themselves, and so when a need for chemical reactions revisions, reverse-engineering, material solution optimization, and most importantly maintenance and proper calibrations of performance/precision measurement equipment is needed, Eclestra can be relied upon to perform these tasks at a reasonable price, albeit at a slow pace, due to qualified, but inexperienced personnel. This may not sound as the most desirable employment roster, but it is entirely purposeful for Eclestra.

This leads to the second possible cause of Eclestra's lasting; excellent reputation among scientific community. As mentioned before, Eclestra does not strive to maintain a roster of experienced scientists, but it collaborates closely with many universities and other education institutions, exchanging information on latest research and discoveries with them freely, offering students internships and sometimes scholarships during their study, as well as permanent employment after graduation, offering aid in composing thesis, etc.. Eclestra has taken a humanitarian approach to science as opposed to corporate one: No capitalization and experimentation without thought of consequence, only to seek income. Information should be freely available to everyone, developed and verified collectively, and used for the advancement of all races.

Third possible reason is that people in Eclestra very well understand their position on the market, and keep in it. The Heads of Staff are aware that even though they could increase prices of their services and increase pay for scientists to keep the bright, ambitious minds on board, they have plenty of megacorporations to deal with, not to mention NanoTrasen likely putting up a lobby to discredit the initiative. Instead they offer services no giant corporation would ever dare to offer and support the whole scientific community, making this its philosophy. The income is mostly used for maintaining the corporation, some is set aside for development and improvements, and some is of course used for salary, albeit those are not particularly high even for prominent members.

Inuvaios Eclestra as a corporation stands only among the small ones, but it is widely renown for growing new, fine scientific minds, making a very good mark in one's resume should their ambitions grow for a more corporate interest. Their economical statistics are truly unremarkable as opposed to other corporations of their size, but it has never been about money for the people of the initiative, but the belief information should be the effort of all races, and free to all races.
