# Religion

Religion, as it has always done throughout Human History, changes and weaves through the patterns of society, surviving for countless 
centuries, but never the same. Religion in the 26th Century is no different, a completely different era for the various churches and 
faiths of Earth, and a new one for the religions that have formed on the various colonies under Human control. 

## The Old World Faiths

It can generally assumed that most, if not all of the major faiths of 20th Century Humanity have survived the last several hundred 
years into the current day, especially so with Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism who were by far the largest religions of the 
time. Many other old-age religions of human history have survived through the centuries, but not to the same degree as the Big Four. 

### Christianity
	
Christianity exists much in the same way that it did long ago - splintered all around by the various different ideas and faiths that 
make it up, from Catholicism to Orthodox Christianity to Mormonism, and even the new-age beliefs such as Joshuaism and Heterodox Christianity.

Today, the largest percentage of Christians (36%) follow the New Roman Catholic Church, named so due to its new location in Vaticano 
Seguendo, in South America. The Current Pope is Pope Leo XXI, who became as such in 2558. Since Humanity expanded into the stars, 
Christianity splintered more and more into various sects of the different branches, all with different ideas on how to move forward into 
the Age of Exploration. Today, there’s thousands of different branches of the faith just in the Inner Systems of Sol Gov.

### Islam

Islam survived into the Modern Day burned and scathed over many years of war and conflict in the Resource Wars of the Hunger Years. 
It came into the Twenty Second Century as strong as it's been since the high of the Ottoman Empire, though it would not last into the 
26th Century. Most of Islam today represents much of what the Sunni faith has for centuries, but there are movements to make parts of the 
faith more moderate and accepting to outsiders, specifically xenobiological life looking to join Islam.

### Hinduism and Buddhism

Hinduism exists much to the same way it did hundreds of years ago, as does Buddhism.

Noted for their more traditionalist ways of thinkings, followers of Hinduism are known for their conservative
approach to xenobiological life.

## Other Faiths

Besides the major faiths, many others have developed over the years on different colonies. Everything from a belief in the power of  
technology to the belief that we are all the children of the Skrell and they are our true masters. Almost everything is out there, 
though some faiths are more dangerous and practiced only in the fringes of society, away from the eyes of Sol Gov.
