## History

Tiamat's existence was first theorized in 2078 as technology marched on and revealed the various extrasolar planets of Alpha Centauri. Amongst those were several "possibly habitable" worlds. No data was truly conclusive, which lead to stagnation of possible colonization programs pertaining this system. The idea of extrasolar colonies was quickly discarded as unfeasible and unable to be done.

The apparent, but slow, success of the various colonies of Mars starting since the 2200s however sparked the interest of corporations of exploiting planetoids outside of the solar system. Thus an expedition, funded by various corporations and a few governments, was sent to Alpha Centauri in 2214, mapping the system.

Tiamat (or at the time called Alpha Centauri D) stood out for its habitation of native lifeforms above the state of mere bacteria. The rich and diversified underwater plant and animal life sparked the interest of biologists and botanists, which led to the foundation of two whole new scientific disciplines, xenobiology and xenobotany (some people jokingly say that it was also the birth of xenocooking). Tiamat was home of the central research station of the time, constructed on the barren land masses and used as central hub of information gathering and coordination, before finally recycled and disbanded as the expedition was finished in 2230.

Bearing message of the richness of life and plenty resources of the planets of Alpha Centauri, the expedition was forgotten due to the great recession the Sol System and especially Earth were suffering at this time. Again, Alpha Centauri and Tiamat were forgotten by the powers of humanity, to the dismay of the investors, who only have made a net loss and some prestigious alien specimens from Alpha Centauri.

Only a century later, with the renewed spearhead of humanity called the Sol Central Government, the old data of the Alpha Centauri expedition was finally recognized and plans were made to colonize and exploit the system. The very first grand construction fleet of humanity was launched to Alpha Centauri at the date of 17th March 2351, considered a historical date for human development.

The goal of the fleet was to construct two bluespace warpgates, a newly developed method of FTL travel, and create the first foundation for colonization efforts. In a rare bout of cooperation, almost all relevant corporations funded the project called "Operation Plotemy", alongside with heavy subsidization of Sol Central and numerous crowdfunding campaigns. Operation Plotemy was planned to take about 8 years of arrival and 2 years to finalize the construction of the Alpha Centauri warpgate, with the Sol Warpgate having already finished construction at the year of 2351.

In a rare occasion of excellent planning, the timeplan held true. In 2358 the fleet arrived on the edge of Alpha Centauri. At 2360 the warpgate went online, the very first in the warpgate net of humanity. Finally, humans have managed to reliably leave the Sol system and establish a lasting presence on the planets of another star.

With travel durations of two months instead of years, the system was flooded with immigrants, adventurers and smaller corporations, who put all their funds into the one-time opportunity of colonizing completely new lands.

Tiamat was originally ignored during this Manifest Destiny, as the planet had no easily exploitable resources, a non-breathable surface atmosphere and little terrain to build structures on. In 2360, the population was only 1000 souls, mostly confined on the small islands working in desalination plants erected for other planets within the system and underwater sea labs.

This changed however in 2362 as "SolCrops" bought out the plants and began rapidly expanding the complexes and built the first foundations of permanent settlements planetside, such as Nova Atlantis, primarily to export agricultural products and water en masse.

The corporation had a full success in this takeover in the planet and Tiamat was very profitable indeed… Until 2388, as a smaller recession and poor business choices let SolCrops go bankrupt and their properties be bought out by others corporations. Not so Tiamat. As the planet's infrastructure was heavily invested into, the planet steadily grown into an independent construct and profitable colony of humanity, managing to buy itself out of the corporate grip and instead go their own way. The population quickly formed assemblies and temporary supervision of Sol Central was shaken off during the years of 2390 to 2400, making Tiamat a state planet alongside Mars.

Since 2420, it is considered one of the core worlds of humanity, which has yet to change.

## Politics and defense

Tiamat, as a political entity, is not united under a single government, with arcologies, floating cities and offshore facilities being independent, sovereign nations. The usual composition of a state on Tiamat is a central arcology with several smaller offshore facilities and settlements under their wings. Although mostly on cordial terms and under the heavy scrutiny of Sol Central, competition is prevalent and sometimes even carried out in wars.

It goes without saying that Tiamat is considered one of the core worlds of humanity and enjoys a protected status in the Sol Central Government. It is one of the oldest colonies of humanity and enjoys a large presence of SolGov police, making piracy almost void, benefiting for the huge merchant fleets of the planet.

The independent city-states of Tiamat still have their own laws and armed forces, despite of the heavy SolGov presence. In general, their armed forces consist of volunteer soldiers that rely on imported equipment and weaponry, most of it acquired from the Vorcian Federation.

## Geography

Tiamat is a fairly large planet, with a diameter of 18000 km. The gravity is just slightly higher than on Earth, but still average enough to allow for continued human life with no gravitational modifications.

Tiamat's surface is almost completely covered in salt water, with only 0.5 percent landmass above sea level during flood. Beyond that, varying amounts of sea depth is observed, with very rich reefs and salt water lake life. The biomass is comparable to that of the Earth, although none land life, flora or fauna, is observed. The water of Tiamat is mostly composed of salt ocean water and must be first processed for human consumption.

In it's natural state, the atmosphere is not breathable due to the relatively small amount of oxygen on it. Due to this, nearly the entire planetary population lives in biodomes that tend to be significantly more vertical than their Martian or Lunar counterparts. With atmospherics equipment in the biodomes, any oxygen on the planet is filtered out and used for maintaining the settlements. The immense majority of the breathable air is constantly being recycled.

## Culture

Tiamat is rare under the core worlds because of their unusually high acceptance of xenos (or rather Skrell) in their population. Although a minority, Skrell are welcomed amongst the Tiamat's population, which influenced their way of life significantly. Philosophy, balance in thought and the exploration of the human mind are significant pursues amongst the population, making the planet somewhat the centre of the scientific humanities amongst the core worlds. Many famous human philologists and philosophers come from or live on Tiamat.

Water sports are hugely popular on the planet, with surfing being somewhat of a planetary spectacle, which is broadcasted on holovids and more. The best way to insult a Tiamatan is to insult surfing, as a saying goes! There are several violent cults (called "surfigans") obsessed with particular surfers that they even go violent amongst each other, a rather troublesome sub-culture on Tiamat.

Tiamat's cuisine is famous in the way that it is only truly enjoyable for people born on the planet. It mostly incorporates seafood, such as the various fish races (introduced by humans or otherwise), kelp, seaweed and algae. A "national drink" exists as well, called "Ocean milk", a thick slurry of fermented algae containing alcohol. Due to its pungent and foul taste, export is almost non-existent.

## Economy

For all of it's history, Tiamat's economy had been primarily based on crop and processed water exports, with the salt, fossil fuel, power generation and tourism industries being fairly relevant as well.

A very large portion of the population works in the first two sectors: approximately a 70% of the entire workforce. Hydroponics is extremely viable and widespread due to the extremely large water supplies the planet contains, with farming outputs being so large that sustaining a huge population is not only easy, but also fully allows for large-scale exports of said goods.

Since the water can't be used for human consumption it's natural state, it's first processed in one of the several thousand water processing plants the planet has. Billions of litres of water are processed in a day and used up locally, or exported with the huge merchant fleets the governments own.

Off-planet trade is extremely important for Tiamat, otherwise the planet wouldn't have access to many consumer goods that aren't naturally available there. A large emphasis on this trade and shipping is exists: in total, the governments currently own about 2500 merchant space vessels to perform trade all over human space.

One of the oldest and most important trade partners of the individual Tiamat nations is the Vorcian Federation on Mars. A solid and stable trade contact and agreements were agreed as soon as in 2368, and both entities are still benefiting hugely from this trade. Tiamat primarily exports crops, processed water and in a lesser part, fossil fuels to the Vorcian Federation: goods that are fairly less common on Mars, but still very demanded.

Tiamat then imports space vessels, robotic equipment, construction supplies, weaponry and general consumer goods from the Vorcian Federation in a large scale. A huge amount of Tiamat's current merchant and military fleet was fabricated in Vorcia, about a 90% of all vessels.

Tiamat is arguably the main provider of water in all human space. Many settlements rely on it for water supplies, to some degree. Over the two centuries of it's existence, the very presence of the Tiamat settlements allowed many new colonies to properly survive and thrive. From Earth, to Mars, to Luna, to Tau Ceti and even to frontier systems like Nyx, Tiamat improves the general standard of living, at least marginally.

The planet is almost completely self-sustainable when it comes to power generation. Huge amounts of ocean territory is being used for wind turbines, solar panels and tidal power plants. Nuclear power plants also exist, along with phoron power plants and supermatter engines in a fair lesser degree: the two latter only account for roughly 3% of all power generation on the planet.

## Notable settlements

### Nova Atlantis

The first permanent settlement on Tiamat, it was built on a very small island in 2362 as a biodome. As time went by, the settlement would expand vertically and grow fast. It was able to formally form a sovereign government in 2392 (named the Republic of Nova Atlantis) that also included several smaller offshore facilities and settlements in a lesser part. With a total population of 700 million in 2559, it's definitely a match for some of the Martian mega-metropolises, at least population wise.
