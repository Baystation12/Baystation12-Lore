## History

Compared to other colonies, the Zzarlaanis is considered to be a young nation, only gaining formal recognition from other governing bodies in only the past century. The earliest contact made was in 2486 by Afolabi Yared, a wealthy intergalactic explorer who originated from a colony on Titan. Yared, alongside two other entire lineages, had set out for planetary exploration in 2463, and had plans to scour the small Herculis system to garner land for future generations. The families managed life within a medium-sized vessel, one which was ultimately designed for hauling cargo as opposed to being inhabited. Either way, it allowed Yared and the rest a plentiful amount of space to store foodstuffs and other materials needed throughout their journey. Their findings took them through several decades of travel, and after examining a handful of potential planetary candidates, Yared had settled on the small and lush grasslands of Tiphonia.

Upon initial contact, much of the planet consisted of small tribes, mostly made up of age-old and abandoned mining operatives that existed on the planet several hundred years prior. The existing technology and resources upon the planet were scarce, and the few that did manage to exist were either in poor shape or were considered useless by modern day standards. In the eyes of the existing inhabitants, the arrival of Yared and his family was considered a saving grace for the starved populace, and was vastly ignored by any other governing figure in the small solar system.

Within a matter of years, the Yared lineage was recognized as an official figurehead for the newly established colony. Construction for living space and other buildings began in 2464, with all materials being salvaged from the previous mining operations that existed on the planet. It was discovered thereafter that Tiphonia was a planet rich in valuable resources, including copper and metals. With use of the abandoned mining equipment, the Yared lineage made great efforts to extract any and all materials that would be considered useful for the expansion of the colony.

By the year 2489, the Zzarlaanis colony had managed to establish a solid infrastructure between the portions made habitable between the portions that were divided for resource extraction. The decision was official made to separate industry from commerce and day-to-day life. The large, rail-like track, spanned for miles between the two separate subdivisions, and carried the valuable resources to and from their production grounds. Nearing the end of his legacy, Afolabi Yared had reached out to a variety of intergalactic trade organizations, where he offered the opportunity for the trade of all resources produced in Zzarlaanis to publically and privately traded markets. This move allowed for a stable source of economy to flow within the community, and ultimately, allowed Zzarlaanis to gain itself a foothold within the metal industry.

At the turn of the century, in the year 2500, the Zzarlaanis community committed a mass slaughter of all tribe members that existed on the planet before their arrival. This decision was made based on the belief that any offspring outside of the three founding families is considered to be lesser, and therefore, not worthy of the privilege it is to live within Zzarlaanis itself.

## Politics

As mentioned previously, the governing body of Zzarlaanis is considered to be that of an Aristocracy. More specifically, the three founding lineages (Yared, Tajeddigt and Tamrat) have combined into one formal governing body, which is known as the Zzarlaanis Trinity. The three houses have an equal influence on the operation of the colony, as each has its own set specialization. The Yared lineage specializes in Industry; the Tajeddigt specialize in Commerce, and the Tamrat specialize in Public Works.

Every 10 years, the populace within the Zzarlaanis colony takes to the polls to vote on the official figurehead, known as the Elector. Three representatives from each family run for the seat, and the winning lineage who gains the seat is considered most influential for what their specialization is. For example, the current Elector over the Zzarlaanis is Onyekachi of the Tajeddigt family. His election was granted seven years ago, where it was promised that the economy of the Zzarlaanis people will be more stabilized. Tariffs and duty would be lowered for citizens, and raised for those purchasing from other communities.

As for armed forces in Zzarlaanis, a small militant group exists under the discretion of the ruling family. Although war is not on the agenda of the Zzar people, it is used primarily as defensive purposes against crime or any exterior threats. As the population within the community is small, these militant groups are granted permission to act as the law for the community, much like a police force. Thankfully, rates of crime are extremely low within the Zzarlaanis, mostly due to the fact that the punishment for criminal behaviour usually ends in capital punishment, such as death.

## Geography

Tiphonia is fairly small by comparison to most other planets, with a radius of approximately 1,500km. However, the topside is covered by dense and lush flora, with most of the surface being dominated by rolling grasslands and expansive prairies. Few mountain ranges do exist, but the lot are mostly uninhabitable, due to the thin air and sub-zero climate. Massive oceans exist on the surface as well, with warm and fairly shallow waters.

The Zzarlaanis colony exists in a region known as the Tubau plains, which is located on the equator of the planet. These rolling plains see to a mostly mild climate, with an average temperature ranging from 20 to 30 celcius. On average, rainfall dominates the calendar year, with around 100 days or so experiencing heavy rainfalls.

Around 60 to 70 percent of the outskirks to the Zzarlaanis colony is taken up by agriculture, with a wide variety of different crops that are grown. Most commonly, the community's staples include corn, wheat and a variety of genetically modified soy products. Livestock is few and far between, with only a handful of pork and poultry producers on the planet. Most other meat products are shipped in, however, many Zzarlaanis people chose to follow a vegetarian diet, and imported products are costly.

## Culture

Reminiscent of ancient African tribes, the Zzarlaanis people follow a lifestyle that is enriched in culture and tradition. The work week consists of only 4 days, where Friday and Saturday are considered a day of rest and prayer, whereas Sunday is considered a day to spend with one's family. Another tradition that is followed by certain families is allowing the wife to live in her own separate house with her children. Although only followed by "extremists", the wife and children live in a separate home from their father, and are cared for under the watch of their mother until the age of eighteen.

Otherwise, much of the Zzar people are dedicated to life of hard labour. It isn't uncommon to see people work well into their elderly status, and often times, work 10 to 12 hour days with few breaks. It is believed by the Zzar people that the gift of labour shows their strength and loyalty towards the colony as a whole, and their workplace dedication will in turn benefit the entire populace of the Zzar people.

Once every year, on October the 2nd, the Zzar people gather in an ancient celebration that has been practiced since the mass exile of the previous inhabitants on planet Tiphonia. Known as "The Dance of the Spirit", the Zzar people give their blessings to the slaughtered individuals by lighting a massive bonfire. Offerings of food and water are thrown into the fire, where the elders within the community are known to dance around the edge of the flame. Oddly enough, it is a day most common for couples to chose their wedding ceremony to take place on, where the day it is considered good luck to the bride and groom.

## Economy

Due to the small population, the economic status within the Zzarlaands is fairly poor when compared to other colonies. Other than the select elite families, most people live in poor conditions, and receive only a pittance from what the rich make. Thalers are considered the only recognized currency, with an average wage of 250 Thalers per month. However, basic necessities required for survival are fairly cheap, and housing is provided by the governing family. Luxury items, such as vehicles or technology, is considered a rarity amongst the general population.

Within the system Herculis, there is little activity from any of the large trans-stellar corporations. Organizations such as NanoTrasen and Grayson Manufactories do trade the raw materials gathered on the planet Tiphonia, however, the payout to the Zzarlaanis colony isn't the largest of sums. Instead, other small corporations that operate in the system are the main source of income for the Zzarlaanis economy.

Only one spaceport is found within the colony, which also happens to be the only one found on the entire planet. The port itself is rather small, and fairly rundown, with only enough space for small cruisers or freight ships to land on. With this in mind, there is little to no travel from other planets to Tiphonia, as tourism within the colony is practically unheard of. Only the few, brave individuals who are looking for a sense of adventure make the trek to the Zzarlaanis colony, and usually don't manage to stay for long.

However, the governing families of Zzarlaanis are in no way in any means of financial difficulty. In fact, they make up for 99% of the richest populace on the entire planet. With their copious amounts of funds, the families have established a fairly solid amount of structures within the colony, each dotted along finely paced roads and sidewalks that are looked after. At first glance, the entirety of the Zzarlands looks quite well-off, but only at a closer examination can one tell that poverty runs rampant.

## Settlements

Technically speaking, the Collation of Zzarlaanis is the only urban centre that exists on both the planet of Tiphonia, and under the control of the Zzarlands government. With only about 250 square kilometers in size, the boundries following the City of Zzarlaanis are quite large in comparison with the population. In fact, there are thousands of structures existing within the city, many ranging from 5 to 20 storeys in height. However, with the entire amount of structures combined, only 30% are inhabited by people, where an additional 15% are used for commercial or industrial use. The remaining 55% of buildings within the city are only shells, or facades, which are made to look like functional structures. These facades were constructed to give an image of wealth and prosperity to the colony, especially should visitors or other trading corporations arrive. In the centre of the city lies the main governing headquarters, which is a large boat-like structure that towers over the other structures in the area. The three founding families live within the building, which is known as the Collective. It is within the Collective that all important governing decisions are made, as well as trade negotiations and agreements.
