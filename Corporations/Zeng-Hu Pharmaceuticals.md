# Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals

*"Zeng-Hu doesn't just buy out corporations... it's more insidious than that. They engulf them. They always ask nicely at first, but if that doesn't work, they begin plotting, conspiring. First they cut off your customers – suddenly, a huge shipment of your products disappears after being seized by an overzealous border control agent, or you lose your biggest customer after their board of directors decides they doesn't want to deal with you anymore. Then, they cut off your suppliers. How are you supposed to make a product when your production facilities don't have power, or supplies, or air? And then, finally, what do they do? They ask nicely again. And you know what? You always say yes."* - Anonymous Former Employee, 2559

## About

### Corporation History

Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals is one of the oldest Trans-Stellar Corporations still in business today, having been originally founded in the late 20th century as a medical research facility located in mainland China. They received their kick into success after the development of their patented mixture of Tramadol, using the recently discovered Inaprovaline to vastly increase its effects. But, don't let the name fool you – this company does more than just pharmaceuticals. Zeng-Hu has been slowly growing in power over the last five centuries as it slowly “established business relationships” with its competitors, willingly or otherwise. From cybernetics, to emergency injection systems, and even genetic manipulation, Zeng-Hu dabbles in it all through various sub-departments, puppet companies, and other varying false fronts. Using this modus operandi, Zeng-Hu has managed to evade anti-trust laws established by the Free Trade Union, and create a quite literal business empire.

### Modern Day

The discovery of phoron at the end of the 25th century has lead to interesting developments for Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals, most notably the rise of one of its greatest competitors – Nanotrasen. The two companies have fought tooth-and-nail over phoron deposits, due to the material's wide variety of uses in the medicinal field. While Zeng-Hu has been staying out of Tau Ceti for the time being due to Nanotrasen's stranglehold on the system, they have been making tentative steps towards Nyx as a potential center for their new phoron research projects. In the meantime, Zeng-Hu continues to offer many diverse medicinal solutions for almost every market. Even Nanotrasen, their biggest rivals, use their patented pharmaceutical formulas, among other products, on their stations and bases.
