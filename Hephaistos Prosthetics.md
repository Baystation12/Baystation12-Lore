#Hephaestus Industries Prosthetic Lineup

As of general position on the prosthetics market, Hephaestus is definitely not negligible, but not the greatest either, that position should be held by Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals (maybe call it Zheng Hu, sounds a lil more Chinese?). Hephaestus offers more bland and somewhat cheaper prosthetics then the lineup I lay out here, but that sees little demand as the audience that would go for this kind of products go to other companies where they can get it at a more reasonable price.

Hephaestus is focusing their prosthetics on mil-spec, specialized products, with most sets operable even if not the entirety of it is ordered (for example the model can feature all limbs, but only legs may be ordered, and it works accordingly).

The X series features models specialized for a given role in the military, or for soldiers of fortune, and are priced adequately to that. This makes for a relatively low volume sold which results in Hephaistos' undeniable, but still not top position on this market.

Less powerful versions stripped of some features or replaced with lower quality components can be ordered. They do retain their model name, but are only classified as HI-Fi models (Hephaestus Industries Fidelity). Those see comparatively higher demand to X series.

##Prosthetic models

Honoring the naming scheme that the TSC sticks to, the main HI-Fi and X series models are Prometheus, Taurus, Helios, Icarus, Adrasteia, Ares, Nostos and Atlas.

###X-01 Prometheus

Prometheus has been developed as one of the first, to alleviate as many issues as possible for veterans that may have lost a limb, or other body part. However this does not only include issues associated with getting used to the new body part, but also the social and official aspects that were associated with any prosthetic compartment, as at the time of development, biomechanical augmentations were on the rise, causing moral disputes over both actual augmentations and regular prosthetic replacements (blablabla Deus Ex blabla).

The augment was designed to look entirely natural to look, feel, smell, as well as to fool all conventional sensory arrays. It is capable of simulating response to some injuries like capillary bleeding, fractures, and bruises. It is even possible to allow administration of medicine and extraction of blood samples via a special channel that ends in a small reservoir near the elbow, thighs, and wrists, that also accomodate simulation of deeper cuts, but only for a very limited time to prevent actual harm to user, only giving time to mend the 'wound' to prevent suspicion.

It also features simulation of pulse of adequate amplitude on various spots of the Prometheus, synchronized with the actual pulse and blood pressure to correspondingly reflect the vital signs. Muscular activity is actually not shielded, making it detectable by bioelectric sensors just as with regular limbs, and if under strain it is made to be visibly contracting adequately.

This prosthetic is also associated with high sustained cost. Not even experienced Biomechanical Engineers can tell a Prometheus limb from an actual one, and so visitations of specialized facilities are required for maintenance. An insurance service can be ordered to have a specialized medical professional dispatched to discretely repair the prosthetic due to emergency, or maintain the prosthetic periodically, approximately once in two months or longer.

### X-02 Minotaurus

After much of the Prometheus' RnD was finished, replacements for military personnel that would still be willing and eligible for active service have begun to be devised. One of the first models that have been finished is Minotaurus. As the name may suggest, this is a prosthetic that is nearly opposite to Prometheus in terms of concealability, being bulky, malformed, and generally aesthetically unpleasant, but brutally strong.

It features a few other disadvantages as well; vast energy comsumption at combat load stands foremost, often requiring further implantations in back and chest to accomodate carrying an additional powerbank that makes for, despite being ergonomically shaped, a slight hunchback in most cases, making the soldier even less appealing. Some clients however take this as an opportunity to work on an intimidating visage, requesting plastic surgery to have things like eye surgeries, longer nails for claws and other beast-themed alterations done to them.

However, few have dared to argue against the benefits Minotaurus brings and lived. Legs feature up to quadruple jump heights, and with modified spinal support, vast carrying capacity, up to 360 kilograms loaded on back. Arms feature a dead lift of up to 500 kilograms, going as far as to allow handheld versions or mounted weaponry to be used commonly, with the smallest caliber that is seen fit for users of this prosthetic being .950 JDJ (a real cartridge), making oversized rifles a reality. Marching load of a Minotaurus is designated at average of 180 kilograms, combat load is designated at 65 kilograms.

Minotaurus usually only sees use with the more infamous mercenaries that can afford the cost, are wicked enough to sacrifice much of their body, and are capable of accomodating the inconveniences and costs associated with extensive maintenance inherent to the prosthetic set. Very few of the Minotaurus users possess the full set, in fact, for the reasons of high cost, energy requirement, and limitations to maneuverability and operating range. The high density of EAP strands also makes it easy for electromagnetic interference to hamper the limbs' operation, being another reason to deter clients from full integration, despite comparatively low implementation cost.

### X-03 Helios

Another model originally designed to accomodate combat-ineffective soldiers, specifically designed to suit commisioned officers and commanders, as well as recon units to a small extent. Structure wise, the prosthetic is purposed to be lightweight and is certified for all-weather operation with EMC level 2 (interference or EMP disrupts operation, forcing a reboot, but sustains no permanent damage to components).

Most of the integration involves implantations to ears and augmentations of eyes and cranium, some of the prosthetics being placed in the back and chest for energy and data processing. Limbs of the Helios set are not mandatory at all, but are outfittable with a variety of sensors and native support of the VR aspect of Helios.

Helios is somewhat unusual in that much of the model's set are not actual body part replacements and augmentations, but auxilliary modules in form of helmets and parts of suits that are mostly purposed for additional sensor arrays and antennae, which is done due to load and maneuverability concerns. These modules are fairly useless to anyone not equipped with the prosthetic, and sometimes do not hamper the user significantly should they lose them or not have them available, being purposed for specialized operation.

Helios also features virtualization of the battlefield, giving the user an option to view a virtual CIC at any time, using it to coordinate their units, datalinks, information of enemy locations and composition, topographic information, and more. Sensory of Helios ranges from high-power optics and thermal imaging, through gunshot detection and medium range radar, to signal interception, decryption or jamming and laser targetfinder.

The actual capabilities of a given Helios unit depend on the outfit of the prosthetics and external modules mounted. While maintenance is relatively easy, allowing for withering harsh environmental conditions for long periods of time behind enemy lines, implementation costs and repairs are high, even among Hephaistos price range.

###X-04 Icarus

Another aspect Hephaistos decided to focus on to outfit the military were specifically recon and scout units. From that alone, it is likely needless to say this prosthetic focuses on low weight, broad operation range and period, and high speed and maneuverability. Integrity-wise, Icarus is not much more durable than regular human bodyparts. As for energy requirement, depending on user, it is actually fairly efficient, powered from nutrients the user consumes, which typically causes carrying a plenfitul supply on longer missions.

Limbs can be also further augmented to integrate a wingsuit, this has been taken as far as to develop an experimental configuration of implanting wings to facilitate a full blown flight. However, this is exceptionally rare, and even the known cases tend to be regarded as rumors, as the extensive spinal modifications mostly resulted in catastrophic failures, causing patient's death, or impairment that warranted a lenghty series of surgery and reconvalescence. The humanoid body is simply incompatible with this evolutionary feature.

Icarus can actually be configured to be so unintrusive it can be combined with other prosthetic models to a small extent, most compatible ones being the Helios and Nostos. Veteran field medics and recon specialists often make use of these combinations, should they afford the cost. The procedure is regarded very risky as commanding officers and medics on the field are commonly targeted. Despite the maneuverability of Icarus combined with acute awareness of Helios making for a very hard-to-kill individual, Icarus users are a prized kill, which makes for great creativity in effort of dispatching them.
