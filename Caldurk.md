## History

When the founding corporation of Brinkburn (Cetedyne Industries) collapsed in 2553, not all of the planet's population decided to stay back. Most of the settlers would decide to stay on the planet, while others decided to try out their luck in other parts of the system. Some of them would move to the nearby asteroid belt, eventually founding Mazes Edge Salvage Outpost, while other more wealthy settlers would attempt to strike far more away, in the more distant Erebus.

Up until 2554, the population and activity in the Erebus sector remained rather low, with only minor independent, sparsely located mining and corporate activity existing, and no notable settlements. Out of over a hundred natural satellites orbiting Erebus, the group of approximately 400 Brinkburnians eventually decided to settle down at a relatively small moon they named Caldurk, which had a high presence of mineral wealth, including phoron.

When the group arrived at Caldurk, they were already the most populated satellite of Erebus, possibly having a higher population than all of the Erebus sector combined at that time. With construction supplies that were earlier brought from Brinkburn, they were able to build a rather crude domed and underground settlement with the same name that was however able to survive the harsh unterraformable and atmosphereless environment of Caldurk, which was similar to Earth's moon.

People in the Nyx system slowly started to hear about this new settlement between 2554 and 2555, attracting all sorts of people, ranging from potential miner colonists to dangerous raiders. No major incidents had occured during that time period however, which allowed the settlement to slowly grow and prosper.

Over the time, even more corporations and settlers would arrive at the Erebus sector and Nyx in general, which gave far more trading opportunities to the settlement of Caldurk. Space stations with several different purposes were built and the colonization of other natural satellites was attempted by other entities, but however Caldurk remained as the most populated one.

The reasoning for this is rather simple. The Brinkburnian group that settled on Caldurk was independent, not related to any government or corporate entity whatsoever. This attracts people of dubious backgrounds or just people who aren't willing to work for any corporation. It was also easy for any generic colonist from another background to move to the settlement, as ordinary working contracts were unheard of during it's early period, with everyone who arrived going their own way, independent.

Caldurk has always had their fair share in mining operations in the region, essentially serving as one of the biggest independent mining and trading hubs not just around Erebus, but the entire system. It could be said that environmental-wise it's far more secure than Brinkburn, the Hauler's Tragedy or Roanake, while the region itself is still predated by the occasional pirate group. However, it's still far more secure than Brinkburn or the Hauler's Tragedy, while remaining less secure than Yuclite or other corporate space stations. Essentially, a decent middle ground for the typical Nyx colonist who doesn't want to live anywhere else.

Caldurk still exists as a settlement in 2559, now with a far larger population and a crude, independent political system. High mineral reserves are still present on the very moon, although there have been known expeditions to other moons for mining purposes launched from Caldurk, which guarantees an extremely high supply of mineral wealth for possible millennia to go.

## Politics

Caldurk wouldn't have been able to survive as an independent settlement if it weren't due to it's high mineral reserves that would allow it to remain relatively wealthy, by Nyx standards. The political system of early Caldurk was the closest and most generic type of anarcho-capitalism that you could imagine, however, that system didn't last for long.

As the population of the settlement grew and security problems arose, the population of Caldurk eventually decided that a proper authority was required. Fearing that the settlement could easily be torn apart with no proper organization, a crude republic was created in 2557. Elections would take place rather commonly, only every two years, with the small government instating very basic taxes for public services, such as settlement maintenance or defense forces.

Even though it's technically a republic, it's not recognized as a sovereign nation by any other entity. Sol Central has too little of an influence in Nyx to care about Caldurk, although some people of Nyx can be heard saying that Caldurk is "the first independent nation of Nyx".

After the creation of the government, things have been more stable. Able to coordinate efforts much more easily now, most notable security concerns had been taken care of, with the new coordinated mineral wealth and tax income being used for the greater good of the settlement.

The settlement has a military police force armed with cheap imported firearms that primarily take care of internal affairs in the settlement, while secondarily dealing with any hostile external contact with the help of spacecraft.

Considering the poor state of other settlements in the Nyx system, it could be said that Caldurk is significantly relevant system-wide, although it's influence is small as it doesn't tend to go more far away than a few nearby moons where mining operations take place.

## Geography

Caldurk is a mid-sized moon with a diameter of approximately 600 km, with only one actual populated settlement existing on it. The government fully claims the entire moon, although like the whole "nation", this claim isn't accepted by any other corporations or entities. However, since no other independent mining operations or creation of settlements have taken place since 2557, it could be said that said claim is infact being followed. This is possibly because there are far too many other available free moons orbiting around Erebus for the typical generic corporation to care about this.

Physically-wise, Caldurk is similar to Luna, although with a lesser amount of craters and slightly higher gravity. When compared to other moons orbiting Erebus, it has a significantly higher amount of mineral wealth, which was decent enough for the Brinkburnian settlers to choose this moon for their new activities.

The housing and settlements in Caldurk are rather crude. Since the moon lacks an atmosphere it can't be terraformed easily enough, if at all. Due to this, the settlement was built in domed environments and underground caves to support an artificial atmosphere.

## Culture

The population of Caldurk is highly multi-cultural, with a high presence of alien races existing. Due to the settlement being recent, it can't be really said that there has been time for an unique culture to arise. People of all backgrounds can be found here, from honest miners to hardened criminals, so really everything can be expected here.

## Economy

Caldurk is a relevant mining and trading hub as of 2559, but it's economy is still almost exclusively mining-based. As many other places in the system, this settlement uses the thaler as it's currency, although mineral wealth is used as a currency sometimes as well.

With said funds, the settlement trades with other ones such as Brinkburn for cheap firearms such as the Ibex 81 to arm it's military police forces, salvage spacecraft for transport and external defense purposes and salvage robots for mining operations. It's known for trading with Yuclite as well, mostly for food and water, along with a few other luxury supplies that are too hard to find anywhere else in the system.

Trade with the Free Trade Union exists as well due to the close location of the Talon's Bull space station, mostly for general supplies. The Free Trade Union has a decent influence on Caldurk, but the Brinkburnian homegrown "corporation" Lumoco Arms and Supplies remains as the main supplier of Caldurkian goods. It's due to settlements like Caldurk why Lumoco Arms and Supplies is slowly gaining a larger influence system-wide, as said goods are always in demand.

With the creation of the government in 2557, the construction of a crude spaceport was possible, which makes arriving and leaving the moon far more efficient and easier. This has allowed the settlement to start gaining a small influence on it's surrounding areas, along with a notable immigration.

Small scale underground farming takes place in Caldurk as well, and other than that, the economy of the settlement isn't too diversified yet. Research is almost completely unheard of, while medical healthcare is more or less acceptable system-wide, but still substandard by galactic standards.
