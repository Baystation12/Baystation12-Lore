# Mars

Mars is a hotbed of Politics in the 26th Century. For the most part, Mars is completely under the control of Sol Gov, but there are still other colonial governments that exist outside of that immediate control, most notable of those are New Liberty, and Vorcian Federation.

### History

The City-State of New Liberty was thought up in 2468 by Marcus Dentan, the Chief Operations Officer of GotoTech Industries, as a safe-haven of freedom, corporate work, commerce, and life. The idea was published in a magazine, with the name Corporate City given to it.

It wasn't until 2476, however, that the idea came up again and looked into by 3 organizations: Gilthari Exports, Astro Media-Journalism Corporation, and the main funding body, The Free Trade Union. Planning began when these 3 organizations began to work together to form the colony, and was thought out as a center of commerce, trade, information, news, and life.

Construction began in 2478 and ended in 2497.

### Politics

The City-State of New Liberty is run by companies. Originally headed by its 3 founders, today, the city has a body of 30 'Guilds' that vote in The Court of Regents.

#### Guilds

Each member of the Court of Regents is a company or organization that has been bestowed the title of Guild by a minimum of 3 pre-existing guilds. Each Guild gets 3 Regents, chosen by any means the Guild wishes to use within themselves.

##### Court of Regents

All Guilds' Regents work in this government institution; 99 Regents exist in all, with the original 3 founding companies having an extra 3 regents each. It serves as the colony's Legislative Branch, making laws, passing them, deciding budgets, regulations, and in rare cases, such as with Hesphaistos Industries, expel Guilds.

Regents are elected by this method: The Guild asks the people for a list of candidates they would like. The Guild can then choose to throw it out, or listen to it. (Usually, employees of the Guild are whom are asked.) The Guild then puts forth a list of Regent candidates to its employees living on the colony, who vote. The regents are then given power. The Regent must be living in or planning to live in New Liberty already.

##### Magistrate of House

The Magistrate of House is the colony's "Leader." They serve as both Executive and Judicial, the Senior Judge in the colony and the person in charge of enforcing laws and representing the colony in conferences and trade/business discussions. The Magistrate of House is elected by the Court of Regents from one of their own; they become Magistrate, and their Regency position vacated, to be filled by the company that the Regent comes from.

### New Liberty - The City

![](https://wiki.baystation12.net/images/thumb/c/cf/NewLiberty.png/799px-NewLiberty.png)
_A color-coded map of the colony_

New Liberty has four seperate space ports,one on each side of the city. Three of these are "Secondary" ports, existing almost soley for nearby industry and commercial needs to be handled. Each Secondary Port has three cargo ship docks and one passenger dock.

New Liberty's northern side has the Primary Space Port, a true hub. Modeled after twenty-first century airports, the Primary Space Port has 20 cargo ship docks and unloading areas and 10 passenger ship gates. The port has a refueling center, a series of resteraunts and bars,murals, and kiosk or many companies' goods.

#### The Rings

The city has a number of rings for different purposes.

##### Red/Government

This ring focuses entirely on government and government relations. The House of Magistrate and Court of Regents are in this ring, as well as agency headquarters such as The Guard (the state police and military, seperated into two departments), the Sewage and Garbage Disposal Services, etc.

This ring also houses 'Embassies'/Consolates from different unions and countries, though few of these buildings exist.

##### Yellow/Commercial

This ring houses the city's commercial needs. Many businesses and company headquarters are here, due to the city's reputation, pro-commerce and pro-company regulations, near non-existant capital tax, and its ideal location on Mars.

##### Blue/Residential

This ring houses all residential needs. Most buildings are multi-level apartments to save resiential space; however, some more expensive homes exist, usually owned by government members, company leaders, and people who rent them out.

Near the ring gate facing The Primary Port, the residential area features mainly hotels and parks.

Most of the Residential Ring is middle class, with some high class homes existing.

##### Purple/Industrial

Outside of the residential ring is industry, the smallest ring. Industry is a minor, but necessary, need for a trade hub/economy center on Mars. This area features more than simple factories; manufacturing plants, canneries, butchery shops, etc. are here, on top of factories.

However, due to strict regulations imposed on pollution by the Court of Regents, actual factories are limited. This is considered the colony's largest problem, but to many is seen as a way to prevent pollution.

##### Gray/Wall & Engineering

Outermost is the city's walls/engineering center. All power generation, engineering staff, air purification, sewage treatment, garbage disposal, refuse management, etc. is handled here. This is where the colony handles its brute work.

A large wall is also built here, massive and towering, a staggering 15 meters thick and 100 feet tall before it begins to slope. The wall was built to keep out raiders and outside danger, as well as help with atmospherics. Still maintained, Engineering is located mostly beneath the wall.

##### Green/Hydroponics Fields

Designed by famous Hydroponic Master Steven Welwright, 4 massive biodomes exist outside the city wall. The purpose was to grow food and livestock to provide a self-sustaining food source to the city, as well as supply much Mars' food importation needs. Today, 3 1/2 of the biodomes function, with the South-Eastern one having suffered a malfunction ending in the destruction of the Biodome's right wing.

20% of the food, meat, milk, eggs, and other farmed goods here are exported outwards, to other colonies on Mars.

### Economy

New Liberty has a strong economy, based on trade, distribution, hydroponics production, and outside tourism to the colony's massive Prmary Space Port that to many is more mall than port.

New Liberty is in an interesting location; being on Mars,it would be an ideal stopping point to resupply on goods and sell merchandise coming from and going to Earth. However, New Liberty is also built on a higher plateau on Mars, giving it natural protection and closer (though minor) distance to the atmosphere's end.

On top of this, New Liberty was built where colonies exist, but no real way to trade existed. New Liberty prospers off of trading wth other colonies and traders, with company's often buying exotic goos that come in.

New Liberty also serves much of Mars' food problems. The four massive biodomes mass-produce fruits, vegetables, grain, dairy, and raises cattle, to supply the city using modern hydroponic systems similiar to trays onboard many stations, but on a much larger scale. Roughly 20% of what is produced is shipped off, sent to other colonies as imports to help earn capital and satisfy the planets importation needs.

### History

In 2051, after several failed corporate-run attempts to make manned missions to Mars, the governments of Earth (mainly Europe and the US) would create a joint-effort to build the first human colony on said planet, while being financially supported by several big corporations of their era. Planifications were made and in the 15th March of 2055, a group of 30 astronauts arrived on Mars, creating a single settlement that earned the name of Vorcia Base.

This settlement would have primary research purposes, and be fairly self-sufficient when it comes to vital supplies. Over the time and up to the 22nd century, more researchers and permanent crew would arrive here, which would cause the settlement to slowly expand. In 2100, it already had a population of 200.

As space travel became fairly more casualized over the time, even more people would decide to leave Earth for this safe Martian settlement. On the 6th November of 2141, another manned mission ran and funded by Indian, European and American governments landed to the east of Vorcia Base, creating the second permanent settlement on Mars: Maza Base.

Since 2144, the project would suddenly gain even more funding, and as terraforming technologies were developed, Mars would be the first target for such a project.

Being the largest settlement on Mars by then, the Vorcians would be the primary responsible people for this terraforming project. This whole project would attract more people as it would be able to supply hundreds, if not thousands of jobs.

In 2200, Vorcia Base had a population of approximately 2000, with Maza Base having around 1200.

After decades of terraforming efforts, a new idea reached the governments and corporations that were funding the Mars project: remodel the five original colonies into domed cities, to allow for a far larger population and economic diversification. The idea was accepted and soon after a huge fleet of construction ships from Earth and Luna arrived at the five original colonies, rushing to give them dome coverage, with thousands of additional workers arriving as well.

Thousands of Vorcians would slowly wander outside their domed city in the search of ore resources, with no additional permanent settlements being formed during this era, as most government and corporate efforts were centered in the main colonies. Additionally, the planet's atmosphere was still inhospitable by then.

Regardless, the colony started becoming truly profitable. Tons and tons of ore resources would be mined down by Vorcians to be sent back to Earth and Luna, this sort of stable work attracting many immigrants.

In 2233 however, a major crisis and depression arose on Earth. Immigration and trade was reduced significantly, and the Vorcian colonies were essentially forced to survive on their own, creating industries that would rely less on off-planet entities, and continuing to expand their settlements as much as they could.

Despite of all this, Vorcia had a slow economic growth during this era that is often named the "Dark Age of Mars", even though it primarily affected Earth. In 2280, business would mostly return to usual.

Mining operations, industrial development and immigration would continue like usual for the next few decades. Vorcia Base was renamed to Vorcia City due to it's far higher population in 2300, which was approximately 800000.

In 2320, Vorcian scientists claimed that the planet's atmosphere was already breathable. One issue would remain however: the deadly cosmic ray radiation. If Vorcians were to create new undomed settlements on Mars, they would be heavily dependant on anti-radiation medicines like hyronalin and arithrazine. This limited the off-dome expansions a fair bit, but regardless it was possible.

By that era however, Earth's governments were very weakened and couldn't care much about other human colonies in the galaxy, if anything they would only be interested in their industrial output. Finally in 2332, scientists at Vorcia City would use their advanced communications equipment to try and maintain a permanent contact with the other isolated and faraway colonies on Mars.

A crude political and economic union was created in the same year: the United Federation of Mars. 2332 is also considered to be the year of the vague "Martian Independence".

The union was fairly ineffective due to the long distances between the settlements, but regardless they had focused on a single objective: expand the water supplies in the northern section of the planet by melting the polar ice cap present in there. This project took place from 2333 to 2341.

In 2345, the federation was dismantled due to it's ineffectiveness, being replaced by the [Sol Central][3] Government, which would allow a far larger degree of freedom and autonomy to the individual Martian states.

Vorcia and Maza would go their own way, sending settlers to properly colonize the outskirts of their capitals, expanding ever since. Many of these new settlements would specialize in farming or mining, as the capitals needed the products.

Vorcian influence over Maza had been steadily increasing over the next few decades, and in 2352 they were annexed by the Vorcian government, but given a fair degree of autonomy. This stable union led to a large nation that had a total population of approximately 300 million by then.

Now unified, colonization and expansion efforts continued to all sides. The mega-metropolises of Vorcia City and Maza City, now the same nation, would continue to grow and grow. Older non-mega metropolis settlements would gain some degree of dome coverage over the time, with huge amounts of land being used solely to supply the main settlements. The Vorcian Federation was now a truly relevant nation in the Sol system.

This situation would continue for a long time. The Vorcian government had adopted a fairly decentralized government system: many Vorcian territories and settlements would be able to organize and govern themselves, as long as they paid a tax to the mega-metropolis, along with food.

Of course this decentralized system would mean that many regions would end up being neglected by the central government. In some parts, governmental authority would be so low that these nations would effectively declare independence and run things their own way. Vorcia had been fairly susceptible to this phenomena ever since unification, and this has been continuing up to 2559.

Minor revolts and armed conflicts have occured due to this, but it's usually cleared out by the Sol Central Government. In 2400, the Vorcian Federation already had a population of 700 million.

While immigration would slowly be reduced since 2430, Vorcia would continue to have a fairly large population when compared to the rest of the planet. By 2500, they already had about 1.5 billion inhabitants.

The Vorcian Federation never focused on any directly managed off-planet colonization efforts, instead focusing on a contiguous mass of land on Mars exclusively.

One of the worst secession attempts occured in 2547, in the Vorcian territory of New Oreland. A well-developed, old Vorcian "core" territory, the incident initially started out as a government protest that escalated into a full-blown secession and military conflict. It took a while for the Sol Central Government to properly clear this specific issue out, as the territory was assumed to be fairly important for the functioning of the Vorcian Federation.

In 2555, the Vorcian Federation was essentially forced by the Sol Central Government and the rest of the Sol community to sign a peace treaty and recognize the newly founded New Oreland nation as independent. The only positive thing that Vorcia gained from this is a specific amount of thalers, which were barely enough to cover the war effort costs and some of the federal government-owned infrastructure present in the lost region. This whole incident had been fairly damaging to Vorcia, as they're still recovering from it.

As of 2559, the federation has a population of 1.9 billion.

### Politics, law, immigration and defense

Vorcia is a very decentralized federal republic. The central government only has absolute control over the Vorcia City mega-metropolis itself, and some other farming-based settlements that are deemed as extremely profitable and vital. To avoid senseless bureaucratic costs in managing faraway territories directly, about a 60% of federal territory is given autonomy to some degree. A good amount of territories are allowed to fully govern themselves, as long as they pay taxes to the central government.

The Maza City mega-metropolis is fairly relevant in this aspect as well. Being the second largest mega-metropolis in the nation, it's given a moderate amount of autonomy. For instance, they have their own military forces, judicial and economic system. Some nearby settlements pay taxes to Maza directly, rather than the central government. This system had been maintained for almost two centuries now, being assumed to be stable and allowing a fair redistribution of the resources.

The head of state is elected by all Vorcian territories every 8 years, with an universal suffrage voting system. However, only citizens are allowed to vote and there are no term limits in this system. Samuel Mirko is the current president of the Vorcian Federation, being in office since 2538. He's fairly infamous, being the most blamed person for the New Oreland disaster. His authority is quite limited, especially in the more autonomous territories.

In general, the politics would be considered to be socially conservative and economically mixed. There are about 50 registered political parties in the nation, most of them being separatist/autonomical. The most important ones are as follows:

The Blue Party: A quite conservative political party, currently the most popular one in the nation. They tend to support a mixed economy, with no governmental restrictions on independent territorial expansion. They generally support secularization and are for restricting non-human immigration.

The People's Party: A socialist political party that primarily wants to remove the immigration restrictions for non-human races that currently exist today, supporting equality for all the races and synthetics. They're also for strengthening authority over the federation's territories, to allow for a more planned economy. They however also have environmental views, supporting the restriction of industrial development to preserve the planet and the domed cities.

The Vorcian Front: A far-right political party that has grown significantly over the last few decades. They're all for fully restricting non-human immigration and the deportation of the roughly 60000 aliens that currently live in the federation today. They support the current mixed economy system, but are also pro military and desire a far higher degree of territorial expansion, with the possibility of them establishing direct off-planet colonies as well.

General immigration has been limited since 2430, but it's still possible. Vorcian citizenship can be acquired after 20 years of living on Vorcian soil, and any children born here are allowed to have this citizenship as well. Non-human immigration is extremely restricted and usually only possible when it's related to a relevant corporation, or for research purposes. They're also not able to acquire citizenship under any circumstances.

Vorcia's international relations are fairly good. Many economic treaties have been established with other nations on the planet and system, so trade with other entities tends to be free and unregulated. Except for New Oreland, they enjoy good relations with most of their neighbors, even former territories.

The Sol Central Government acquires a good chunk of it's temporary manpower from Vorcia, after a series of treaties in the latter part of the 24th century. They mostly see action in intergalactical peace missions and violent armed conflicts back on Mars, such as the New Oreland disaster. In exchange for this, the Vorcian military and merchant fleet is allowed to use many Sol Central Government controlled space stations, outposts and military bases.

Vorcia maintains a large volunteer army that is also backed up by foreigners, which are allowed to enroll in the army. 0,5% of the population are currently active in the military or are reservists at the moment, approximately 10 million in total. Their military budget is acceptable, approximately a 2% of the nation's GDP. The technological level of the armed forces in general is modern and efficient, as they also share technology with the Sol Central Government. Pulse rifles, laser carbines, combat exosuits and bluespace artillery are common place.

Their space fleet could be considered to be strange, as most of their military vessels also double as merchant vessels to reduce costs. Currently there are about 1500 military space vessels active in service, with about a third of them being doted with [FTL engines][4]. Most of them, however, are of a small category.

In most of the Vorcian territory, guns are tighly restricted. However, in many of the more "frontier" rural areas this restriction is less strict, and guns are more commonly seen there. Typically and on a general federal level, a citizen will have to pass several safety courses and gun marksmanship tests to get a gun license, and each individual gun has to be registered. Laser carbines and stun energy guns tend to be the most popular in this nation, as they're able to subdue an attacker without causing massive damage most of the time.

Even though guns in the hands of ordinary citizens aren't a very common thing in most of Vorcia, the right of self-defense is heavily still respected. Both stand-your-ground and castle doctrine laws exist.

The correctional system is fairly liberal. Death sentences and life imprisonment are not a thing on a federal level, and although forced labor was very oftenly used in the 24th century, the practice is far less common as of now, barely being used on the mainland. The prisons tend to have acceptable accomodations with a focus on rehabilitation. Most of the prisons are directly run by the federal government, with roughly 5% of them being private-run. In the more neglected or undeveloped territory, the Sol Central Government has the authority to deal with criminals on their own. In general, if the offense is particularly severe (mass murder, rape etc.) the federal government can ship the criminals off to a more secure place ran by the Sol Central Government. A good example of this would be the moon Phobos, an old penal colony still being used in 2559.

About all recreational drugs are legalized in most of the territories, however they are heavily taxed. This has caused a drug trade black market in some of the territories, particularly in the more neglected ones.

### Geography and climate

The Martian landmass in which the Vorcian Federation is based on has been [terraformed][5] to an acceptable degree. Man-made forests and national parks exist all over the nation, being strictly protected by the government. The temperature on the territory can feel fairly extreme: usually ranging from -20º to 50º celsius. Occasional rain exists, but it's not too intense which makes it good for agricultural operations.

A huge chunk of the territory is being used for farming: roughly a 70% of it. By default, the soil is acceptable for farming. With modern technologies however, the farming efficiency is improved significantly which allows for far more land to be cultivated.

Vorcia borders the Great Northern Ocean to the north. There are several small lakes and rivers in the nation, but it's nothing overly noteworthy.

### Culture and society

Due to the nation being essentially a melting pot of various Earth cultures, it's very mixed. For instance, human on human racism is mostly a non-issue here, with only a few extremists paying attention to it. However, this society can be considered to be fairly human supremacist, especially lately with the discovery of races like the [Unathi][6] and [Tajaran][7].

Women and LGBT groups have enjoyed a fair degree of equality ever since the initial days of the federation. It's typically considered to be a non-issue right now, usually not mentioned in politics.

Synthetics such as robots are widespread across the entire nation, but often tend to be discriminated against. Sol Central Government law and jurisdiction applies in a full force here, with shackling, indenture and ownership contracts being used and respected almost fully to the letter.

Vorcia's national sport is football (soccer), which had been introduced by European settlers between the 21st and 22nd century. Since Mars has a low gravity, a new style was developed: low gravity football. With the advent of gravity generators, high gravity football has originated as well, being fairly less popular however. "Normal" football is played too, if the stadium has a gravity generator. By far, the low gravity variant is the most popular one, as most settlements lack gravity generators.

The first low gravity football stadium was built in Vorcia City in 2167. It still exists as of now, being renovated and expanded regularly, now having been modified to support several gravity settings.

### Economy

Vorcia's economy is very mixed. Typically, private housing (70%) dominates over state housing (30%) on a federal level, but this can vary a lot depending on the territory. Most of the mines in the territory have either been sold to corporations or are owned by the different governments. When it comes to land, it's possible for a Vorcian citizen to buy it if they want it. However, prices tend to be fairly high for even the smallest plot of land imaginable, as the governments currently control about 60% of all cultivated farmland in the moment.

Since the nation has such a high population along with the high food demand that comes with it, agricultural operations are the main sector here. Approximately 30% of the adult population work in the farming section, but usually not as their main profession. Corn is the main crop grown on the vast Vorcian farmlands, typically genetically modified to survive and thrive better in the Martian environment. Urban farming is common and very viable, typically performed in hydroponics installations in tall skyscrapers.

Despite the high percentage of workers in the farming sector, Vorcia is by no means a primitive or backwards nation, economically wise. While a 5% of the population work in the mining sector, it also has a fairly high degree of industrialization: approximately 10% of the population work in factories. The Vorcian industry sector specializes in the construction of spaceworthy vessels, ship components and artillery in general.

Vorcia exports mainly space vessels, ship components, vehicles, civilian-type exosuits, electrical machinery, pharmaceutical products, iron and steel. It primarily imports coal, petroleum, food such as corn, and ample water supplies. Lately, [phoron][8] has been a major import resource as well, but it's still mostly used for a few state-run power generation plants and military purposes.

The taxes tend to be fairly low for corporations at a federal level, which allows them to thrive and provide their services on Vorcian soil. [Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals][9] is extremely important for the nation as they're the main provider of vital medications such as hyronalin or arithrazine. The Vorcian state has been attempting to fulfill this medication demand with their own factories for a while now, but they can't keep up.

Income tax and minimum wages tend to be average on a federal level. The government provides almost full medical coverage to all of it's citizens (except for cloning, which isn't covered by the free healthcare system in the immense majority of the federation's territories) and thus requires a generous level of taxation to fund this. That system had been maintained since the mid 24th century, when some settlers simply wouldn't have been able to leave their domed cities for colonization purposes without this.

Education is predominantly more state-run than private. All citizens are entitled to a free education up graduating secondary school. Children enroll for primary school at the age of 6, enter middle school at the age of 12, and enter secondary school at the age of 16. After graduating secondary school (typically at the age of 18, unless they fail too many courses), they're allowed to enroll in college, which is typically not free in most territories. Dropping out is only legally possible after the age of 16: all children under this age are to be enrolled in any educational institution. Educational contents might vary excessively depending on the region.

State-run research efforts exist, but are vastly outclassed by the private corporations that have a presence on it's soil.

For power generation, it's still highly based on traditional methods such as nuclear power plants, coal power plants, and petroleum power plants. Solar power generation isn't very viable on Mars and thus doesn't take a great part in this. Recently, supermatter engines and [phoron][8] generators have seen a presence on Vorcia but are still outclassed by the rest: only a 5% of the power generation in Vorcia is based on it.

And as with most other settlements in the known galaxy, the Vorcian Federation uses the thaler as it's main currency.

### Notable metropolitan areas

There are two mega-metropolises in the Vorcian Federation, with about a 70% of the total nation's population living in them.

#### Vorcia City mega-metropolis

The main urban deployment in the federation, with a population of 1.1 billion inhabitants. It's the capital of the nation and the headquarters of the federal government, with most international embassies being based here too. It consists of 56 clustered domed cities, with 8 of them having an artificial gravity in it's majority. In total there are 134 registered municipalities, with 35 of them not having any dome coverage. 12% of the population live underground.

#### Maza City mega-metropolis

The second biggest urban deployment in the federation, with a population of 500 million inhabitants. It consists of 20 clustered domed cities, with 3 of them having an artificial gravity in it's majority. In total there are 67 registered municipalities, with 13 not having any dome coverage. 9% of the population live underground.

### Other notable settlements

#### Conriston

About 550 square miles in size. Population of 32 million. Fully covered with a radiation-proof biodome. Independent atmospherics system. No gravity generators. Significant underground expansion, mostly from the early era. Part of the Vorcia City mega-metropolis. Area first settled in a large scale since 2360. Recognized as a Vorcia City municipality in 2373. Sealed off with a biodome in 2422. Territorial division in 2482. Same dome, but West Conriston is 290 square miles with a 14 million population. East Conriston is 260 square miles with 18 million pop. East Conriston tends to be fairly poorer than the westside.

#### New Aaronshire

An open-air settlement 2700 kilometres away from the Vorcia City mega-metropolis, to the northeast. Population of 180000. Low degree of political and economic autonomy. Primarily founded as a mining community, with significant agricultural operations as of 2559. The settlement was first founded in 2392 and registered in 2401.
