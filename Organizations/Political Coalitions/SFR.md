## History

Founded: 2431

## Inter-coalition relations

Progressive Alliance Of Citizens – Very rarely agree outside of basic rights.
Sol of Nations & Order – Occasionally agree, but viewed as too extreme.
United Green-Left Of Sol – Almost never agree.
Leftists For Direct Democracy & Freedom – Never agree.
Citizens For Free Enterprise & Trade - Sometimes agree.

## Ideology

Made up of center-right to right-wing parties. Pro-federalism (i.e, more general autonomy for member states), generally pro-religion, pro-human rights. Mildly xenophobic. Very large, so popular just about everywhere.

## Factions

* Christian Democrats – Once the prevailing ideology in conservative parties of the old European Union, Christian democracy is a shadow of its old self. Though not the smallest faction, the religious right make up only a sizeable minority of coalition members.
* New Right – Atheistic, pro-federalism and somewhat xenophobic, the “new right” isn’t actually all that new, tracing its origins back to the 23rd century. Somewhat reactionary to the increasingly left-leaning current of social values, the new right quickly cemented itself as a force to be reckoned with in the SFR’s predecessor.
* Neo-paleoconservatives – Tracing itself back to old America, neo-palcons are a more extreme variant of the vaguely European Christian democrats. Pro-federalism, pro-religion, and most of all pro-human. Generally talks about "saving the human race", though how exactly the human race can and should be saved is fairly unclear at times.
* Libertarian Right – almost annoyingly pro-federalism, anti-gun control and pro-drugs legalization, the libertarian right seems somewhat out of place due to its view that ALL drugs should be legalized. Meth. Heroin. The kind of drugs that rot your eyes and make you want to fuck goats.. the libertarian right believes that everyone has the right to choose.
* Corporatists - It's called a lobby, kid.
