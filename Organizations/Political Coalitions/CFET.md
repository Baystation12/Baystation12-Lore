## Ideology

Capitalism can hardly be considered an ideology. A party made entirely of "bought" politicians, the CFET has a single goal: money. If something can somehow give transtellar corporations more money, then they will no doubt support. Quite frankly, they might even be behind it. Few member states have many people who support the CFET.

## Factions

* NanoTrasen - This faction generally tries its best to covertly further the interests of just NanoTrasen while trying to make sure the rest stay wherever they are. Lots of stuff related to scientific research and phoron safety laws.
* Hephaestus - Another faction for the interests of a single corporation, Hepheastus generally tries its best to fight against gun control. After all, more guns sold is usually more profit for them.
* Zheng-Heu - Guess who these guys are all about? Generally tries to make themselves less accountable for less than stellar medication and medical research.
