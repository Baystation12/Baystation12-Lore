## History

Founded: 2520

## Inter-coalition relations

* Solarians For Freedom & Rights – Never agree. Sometimes insults.
* Sol Of Nations & Order – Never agree, under any circumstances. Attempt to block anything forwarded/supported by. Always insults.
* Progressive Alliance Of Citizens – Occasionally agrees. Sometimes insults.
* United Green-Left Of Sol – Almost always agrees outside of minor ideology differences.
* Citizens For Free Enterprise & Trade - Never agree.

## Ideology

Made up of far-left to “post-left” parties. Authoritarian socialists, Neo-Jucheists, Stalinist-Maoist-Castroist-Marcosists. Always anti-capitalist. Believes in getting rid of the military. Does not like this style of democracy. Against member state autonomy. Against further colonization. Generally more popular on the frontier.

## Factions

* Neo-Jucheists – Juche was the prevailing ideology in North Korea. Actually, Juche was the ONLY ideology in North Korea. With little influence, Neo-Jucheists are the butt of many jokes and members of SNO and even the SFR have taken to calling Chairman Caroll “Eternal Leader.”
* Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist-Maoist-Castroist-Marcosists – Is that name long? So is the history of the class struggle. Outright supports a violent revolution, parties within this faction almost always have an armed paramilitary wing. Just remember: communism is universal, so it’s never been tried before. Workers of all worlds, unite!
* National Bolsheviks – Perhaps the most reasonable faction, which is saying very little. National Bolsheviks don’t believe in a universal revolution. They do, however, believe in socialism in one country.. planet, whatever.
