## Ideology

Made up of right-wing to far-right parties. Very xenophobic, pro-military, for more colonization. Split between leaving the Confederacy and starting another war to try and seize “what is rightfully SolGov’s.” Sometimes anti-capitalist. Almost always pro-colonization and in some cases pro-war with other nations, some even advocating a form of "legal war" between member states to settle disputes. Quite popular on the frontier and prisons.

## Factions

* Formalists – Few words could describe formalists other than odd. Transhumanist, anti-democracy - in most cases seeming to advocate a restoration of monarchies - and anti-rights in general. Formalists are reactionary to the extreme, socially wanting a return to the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. A theoretical transhumanist benevolent god-king/AI has yet to show itself, so formalists are relegated mostly to writing nearly incomprehensible political manifestos.
* Post-right Fascism – Evolved Strasserists who uncomfortably stand in alliance with the rest of the coalition. Describable as “economically to the left, socially to the VERY far right.” Having long since abandoned anti-Semitism, fascism now generally positions itself against xenos, xeno rights, and democracy in general. Quite vaguely against most major megacorps, borne from the belief that they have yet to be put under the rightful control of a benevolent dictator.
* Religious Far Right – The religious far right believes that mankind has lost its ways, mainly owing to its current lack of widespread religiosity. Generally against abortion, birth control, and vat-grown humans, the religious far right is vaguely federalist outside of minor social issues. A small part of them believe greatly in furthering and greatly accelerating colonization and "converting" xenos.
* Hypercapitalists - As long as something doesn't violate the NAP, it should be legal. Tracing its roots back to Ayn Rand, Anarcho-capitalism and Hans Hoppe, hypercapitalists believe that whatever is good for business is ultimately good for the people. Pro-megacorp up to a point - hypercapitalists do believe that corporations that mislead the public should be penalized, despite common belief.
