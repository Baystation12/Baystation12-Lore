## Ideology

Made up of center, center-left, and left-wing parties. Pro-integration of aliens, generally against increasing funding for the military. Mixture between being anti-megacorp and pro-megacorp. Not for colonization. Very much against the Confederacy. Very large, so popular just about everywhere.

## Factions

* Social Democrats – The supposed traitors of the 1918 revolution in Germany, socdems have survived the past few centuries generally unmolested, unlike the Christian Democrats. The largest faction in their coalition, social democrats are generally.. well, social democrats. They’re for more expansive healthcare, even for non-citizens. They’re also for taking in more refugees and furthering aid to other, less fortunate planets. Generally not for unrestricted capitalism, so can be considered anti-megacorp.
* Liberals – “Ten degrees left of center in the good times, ten degrees right of center when it affects them personally.” Generally pro-capitalist and pro-status quo when in power, liberals are the odd ones out among the factions in left-leaning coalitions. Decried as bourgeoisie and even reactionary, liberals seem less dedicated to a coherent ideology and more dedicated to keeping the right out of power. Pro-megacorp, though this is rarely talked about.
