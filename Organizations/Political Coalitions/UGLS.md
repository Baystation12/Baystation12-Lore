## History

Founded: 2513

## Inter-coalition relations

* Solarians For Freedom & Rights – Almost never agree.
* Sol Of Nations & Order – Never agree, under any circumstances. Attempt to block anything forwarded/supported by.
* Progressive Alliance Of Citizens – Occasionally agrees.
* Leftists For Direct Democracy & Freedom – Almost always agrees. Too militant.
* Citizens For Free Enterprise & Trade - Never agree.

## Ideology

Made up of left to far-left parties. Believes in letting aliens within Sol space vote, believes in automatic citizenship granted to anyone within Sol space longer than a year. Against funding the military a lot. Generally anti-capitalist. In general, against megacorps and further colonization. Popular on certain planets within Sol.

## Factions
* Greens – The greens are.. well, green. They’re against nuclear power, the use of singularity engines, and a few of them even think that using bluespace causes pollution. They’re also against further funding the military, and actually want to cut back on it some. The Greens are actually for the Expeditionary Corps, though, and want to fund it even more. Very much against continuing colonization and helping megacorps.
* Democratic Socialists – Marx influenced socialists who actually believe that change can come about without a violent revolution. Yes, there is a difference between them and social democrats. Democratic socialists are generally more to the left and take direct inspiration from the words of the prophet Marx. Seize the means of production. Do it now.
* Left Federalists – Left federalists are a lot like their right-leaning counterparts, though generally they’re influenced by leftist thinkers and ideologues. They, naturally, believe in a certain degree of autonomy for member states of Sol.
* Communists – General Marxist-Leninist influenced parties/members. A sizable minority, and a vocal one at that. Potentially sees the value in a violent proletarian revolution, potentially with a vanguard party. Seize the means of production. DO IT NOW.
