## Overview
The Terran Confederacy is a union of independent human colonies spread over a wide region between Resomi and SolGov space. Living conditions and systems of government vary widely across the Confederacy because of its loose, federalist system of control, however most colonies have joined the Confederacy as an alternative to membership in the Sol Central Government, or for protection.

### [History](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/TC/TC-History)
* **Founded**: 31 July 2443

The origin of the Terran Confederacy has its roots in humanity’s first colonization wave, during the late 23rd century. Before Bluespace drives and Gateways, exploration and early colonization was only possible with generational ships, and cryogenically frozen crews, journeys which took decades to reach their destinations, even at near-light speeds.

Today, the Terran Confederacy broods. Wounded, and defanged, but not destroyed, it has been attempting to salvage what economic and military might it had, and debate continues within Parliament as to whether or not a more centralized, powerful government is needed. SolGov maintains a close watch on its border with the Confederacy, and recently has begun a buildup of spacecraft and personnel in response to the Confederacy’s reactivation of the shipyards above Novaya Zemlya. In general, the citizens of the Confederacy are discontent, blaming SolGov or nonhumans for their worsening living conditions and economy. 

## [Government and Politics](https://baystation12.net/lore/TC/TC)

As the name suggests, the Terran Confederacy is a Semi-Presidential Confederacy, with a comparatively weak central government to SolGov, and strong member states. 

### Foreign Relations

As a government, the Confederacy is a largely insular body, engaging in trade with trans-stellars, and independent human powers, but otherwise keeping to its own devices. While some immigration does take place, individual members may permit or deny entry as they see fit. The largest nonhuman denomination is Skrell, largely confined to merchants and corporate employees. Tajara can also be found in larger-than-average numbers because of Ahdomai’s proximity to the Confederacy. The Confederacy does have formal diplomatic contacts with those regional powers that are interested in such things, SolGov included, though rarely use diplomatic pressure to achieve their goals.

Prior to the Gaia Conflict, alongside regular applications to join the Confederacy, member states would often annex bordering colonies, habitats, and territory for a variety of reasons, some more legitimate than others. Currently however, regional ambitions have been tame, with some outlying systems joining SolGov, or going neutral.

* Sol Central Government: Formal Diplomatic Contact. Citizens of SolGov must apply for Visas to enter any Confederate Territory. Poorly maintained trade stations exist on the border where free movement is permitted. The Confederacy is currently under the terms of a peace treaty with the SCG, forbidding a standing military, the operation of military shipyards, and mandating regular aid payments to a number of systems affected by the Gaia Conflict. Continued adherence to the treaty is ensured by regular visits by SolGov Observers.
* FTU/Corporate space: Amicable relationship. While some SolGov member states avoid trade with the Confederacy for the sake of appearances, many unaffiliated corporations and FTU businesses trade regularly with the Confederacy. With a largely self sufficient basic economy, luxury goods and advanced technology are the most desired products from the rest of human space.
* Skrell City-States: Formal diplomatic contact. Skrell are permitted entry and residency to the Confederacy with visas, however not all individual member states permit Skrell entry.
* Dionaea Gestalts: No contact.
* Vox Shoals: No formal contact. Minor raids have occurred, but no large scale Vox action has occured in confederate space.
* Ahdomai: Formal diplomatic contact. Cold relations due to the status of Tajara in confederate society, however some member states make great use of Tajaran labor.
* Moghes Hegemony: No contact.
* The Positronic Union: No formal contact. Positronic brains are imported by the Confederacy, but are not known to be manufactured within its borders.
* The Fury of Mankind: The Confederacy quietly supports a number of anti-nonhuman movements, and other anarchical or anti-government organizations in SolGov space, the FoM included. 

### Defense and Law Enforcement

Before 2550, the Terran Confederacy had a standing military, consisting of a Navy and Army for operation in space and planetside respectively. In the early 2500s, the Confederate Armed forces were considered the strongest standing military force in human space. When the Confederacy went to war with SolGov, the SCG had major disadvantages in both manpower and technology, resulting in significant early losses. However, after the resolution of the Gaia Conflict, the remains Confederate Military were dismantled, with most vessels and materiel being scrapped or sold to pay for war reparations. Today, individual member states provide for their own defense, with military ability varying depending on location. In times of need, the Confederacy is permitted by its treaty with SolGov to assemble a combined force with member state resources and troops. Because of the moratorium of military shipyards within the Confederacy, many vessels are poorly equipped, or hand-me-downs purchased from corporate asset protection forces. While some individual forces, such as the Terran Guard in Gilgamesh, may be of high quality, most member states only have numbers to rely on.

Law enforcement is handled by individual member states, with some laws varying widely depending on location. Disputes between member states are handled by the Confederate Tribunal, a temporary body formed when needed by randomly selected members of Parliament. Extradition treaties are common between members, but not universal, with some member states being known has havens for fleeing criminals. The Terran Confederacy does have a basic legal code within its Constitution, but it is only used during disputes between members, now that its standing military has been dissolved. 

## Territory

The Terran Confederacy currently encompasses 97 member states, spread over 34 systems, spread in a generally spherical pattern around Gilgamesh, and situated between SolGov and Resomi space. While some member states do encompass entire planets, many are smaller colonies, both planetside, or dug into asteroids. It has almost a dozen corporate members, but only one could be considered a Trans-Stellar: HelTek Arms, a weapons and spacecraft manufacturer headquartered in orbit around Novaya Zemlya. 

HelTek isn’t a popular brand in SolGov due to sanctions stemming from the Gaia Conflict, but their products are commonly seen in the inventories of private security companies and frontier law enforcement personnel because of their rugged designs and ease of use. Surplus HelTek STS-35s built during the prelude to the war with SolGov can still be bought unused in many less-than-legal markets.

## Motives and Beliefs

The Terran Confederacy, while made up of many separate member states, generally operates based on its official motto: Liberty, Sovereignty, Unity. Its founding members split from SolGov in order to pursue their own path, and protect their own rights. Government regulations and legal blocks are few and relatively weak, making the Confederacy attractive to people, corporations, and governments who wish to go their own way, outside the prying eyes of a big brother. As a largely human organization, the Confederacy and its member states prioritize defense against their Resomi neighbors over internal defense, and are constantly on alert for SolGov interference in their space. While individual member states may disagree, and even fight on occasion, if an external threat were to arise, the Confederacy would unite to repel it. 

## Culture
Terran culture is as varied as it is in most of human space. While many customs and traditions were carried from Earth, especially from the homelands of the original colonists, culture and lifestyle varies widely depending on location.

### Entertainment

While largely similar to other Human organizations, there is one entertainment event in the Confederacy that has spread beyond its borders in a large way: Thunderdome. Originally envisioned as a way to formally resolve duels, Thunderdome has flourished into a reborn form of gladiatorial combat. While it has been officially denounced by the Assemblies, Thunderdome is popular in many member states that allow its broadcast, and even more watched on the frontier, outside of SolGov space.

Thunderdome matches can range from organized bouts using a single martial art, and only fighting to a pre-agreed on number of downs, to no-holds-barred deathmatches using energy weapons. Generally agreed upon is that thunderdome matches take place between two or more consensual competitors, typically in a standardized court, a circular dome with slatted sides for climbing, although special events and matches use nonstandard courts, or take place over natural terrain.

Thunderdome duels still are permitted in some confederate member states, and participants have an option to broadcast these duels, granting the winner prize money. Most common however, are standard team matches, with 6 individuals on each side, armed either with a standardized melee weapon, or with weapons that can be found on the court.

## [Economy](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/TC/TC-Economics)
* **Imports**: Phoron. Bluespace Drives. Luxury Goods. Plant Genes. Positronics. Foodstuffs.
* **Exports**: Raw Materials. Industrial Equipment. Weaponry. Spacecraft. Helium-3


## Science and Technology
Overall, confederate technology is similar to technology in the rest of society, and considering the flow of goods and technology, this is unsurprising. Many member states lag behind in some areas, depending on the level of development. Most notably, the Terran Confederacy is unable to build its own positronic brains, and a lack of Phoron prevents the construction of Bluespace drives and use of Phoron-based medications.

More developed confederate members tend to outpace their SolGov peers in shipbuilding, and heavy industry. Confederate machinery is more rugged and dependable, if not as user friendly and sleek as SolGov-built equipment. Confederate military vessels, when they were still built in Gilgamesh, were second to none, and the reactivation of the shipyards above Novaya Zemlya has PMCs and colonial defense forces giddy in anticipation.

Of special note is the stealth technology the Terran Confederacy equips its spacecraft with. Advanced thermal dissipation and jamming technology, alongside hulls made from metamaterial alloys give confederate spacecraft, habitats, and weaponry a significant edge over their adversaries, or at least did while they were still made. 

## Hazards and Crime

The Terran Confederacy is not a soft place. Laws favor states, and citizens over visitors, and citizens of SolGov are advised to tread softly. Outer member states tend to be similarly dangerous to frontier colonies, law is maintained by local forces, and only to the point enforced by individuals. A town sheriff is just as likely to shoot you for your trouble as they are to put you in front of a judge. There are a few established gangs, pirates, and mercenary groups, and less-than-legal business is easy to find in many areas, member states to look the other way if criminals do most of their damage outside of their borders.

Nonhumans are particularly disadvantaged, with many member states not only denying citizenship on the basis of species, but outright denying them legal protection. Tajara especially are seen in a negative light due to their homeworld’s proximity, and reputation for taking good industrial jobs. Nonhumans are more accepted closer to Gilgamesh, but one could never call the Confederacy friendly to anyone but humans.

## Restricted Information

In the waning months of 2559, a SolGov Fleet vessel carrying a number of sapient rights observers on a routine survey of the Terran Confederacy disappeared while returning to SolGov. Publicly, this vessel was destroyed in a tragic Bluespace Drive accident. In actuality, the vessel was attacked by advanced spacecraft belonging to the Confederacy. The vessel managed to take refuge aboard a corporate space station outside confederate space, and despite the ensuing loss of that station and the vessel, at least one survivor managed to carry a report back to SolGov. That report revealed that the persecution of nonhumans in the Confederacy was much more than initially believed. The observers had stumbled upon a labor camp entirely staffed by nonhumans. These nonhumans were being forced to process an unknown mineral in barely survivable conditions. 

The observers were unable to discover if the operation was directly supported by the Confederate Parliament, but due to the response of unregistered Confederate Military, it suggests that the operation is likely endorsed, and may be larger than observed. Later attempts to gather intel on the site found that it had been destroyed from orbit, and closer examination remains impossible due to an increased military presence in that system. Many in the Defense Forces consider another conflict inevitable, however the Secretary-General wishes to avoid war if at all possible. For the time being, information about this development has remained classified, for fear of actions that other organizations, especially nonhuman governments, would take if they learned of it.

High level intel reports by the Office of Interstellar Intelligence caution that in addition to the labor camps, rumors continue to circulate of a renewed interest in stealth technology within the higher circles of confederate government, and believe that information gleaned from the damaged spacecraft discovered in ‘57 have aided the Confederacy in creating a new stealth alloy. As a result, increased research into sensor technology has been quietly funded by SolGov.

## Notable People, Places, and Things

### Charles Turner, Speaker of the Confederacy
Born on Novaya Zemlya to a pair of industrial laborers, Charles Turner grew up intimately familiar with hardship. He rose from poverty by enlisting in the Confederate Army, and by the time the Gaia Conflict was over, held the rank of Major, having been promoted meritoriously for actions throughout the war. Upon returning to civilian life after the military was disbanded, Turner felt betrayed by the Parliament for their surrender, and decided to enter politics in order to change things. After becoming a popular representative, Turner ran for Speaker, and was elected by a significant margin. Considered by many Confederates to be a hero, Turner has focused his attention on strengthening parliament, and the central confederate government, as well as reactivating much of the old military industrial complex.

### Maelstrom Shipyards and Foundry, Novaya Zemlya Orbit
Orbiting Novaya Zemlya, the Maelstrom Shipyards and Foundry is the largest spacecraft manufacturing complex in human space. A massive construction, the shipyard contains mineral processing plants, industrial fabrication centers, and massive berths for constructing everything from drones to supercarriers. Largely shut down after the Gaia Conflict due to damage and the treaty with SolGov, it has been reactivated as of 2560.

### The Obelisk, Terran Orbit
A massive slab of black marble native to Ameranth Minor, the Obelisk is a monument to the men and women who gave their lives for the Confederacy during the Gaia Conflict. Measuring exactly 250 meters in height, an entire side is taken up by those lost inside and around a gateway when SolGov forces destroyed it with nuclear weapons. It is regularly visited for memorial services, and has become a symbol for Speaker Turner’s push to strengthen the Confederacy. One of the better guarded orbital features in Terra, it is kept in orbit by a small service station attached to its base.
