# Terran Economics

The Confederacy’s most prosperous member states tend to be industrial, focusing on spacecraft design, mining, or producing consumer goods like machinery and vehicles. The Confederacy is one of the largest exporters of equipment for fledgling colonies, with the exception of terraforming equipment. 

Because of a growing population, the Terran Confederacy has increased its purchases of food from outside the Confederacy, however many in SolGov are unwilling to sell to confederate buyers because of the Gaia Conflict. 

As previously mentioned, there is only one Trans-Stellar Corporation based fully within the Confederacy, HelTek Arms provides equipment to most member states, as well as many third parties and external factions. Other notable corporations include Almeida Corporation, a home supply and furnishing corporation known for its easy to assemble designs, and popular line of fabricators and lathes for use in colony construction, and CarryQuick Delivery.

Because of the separated nature of confederate members, there is no unified shipping or postal service, a niche filled by CarryQuick, which is responsible for most interstellar freight within the Confederacy.

While many confederate citizens enjoy a greater level of individual prosperity than the average SolGov citizen, there is a greater proportion of poverty within the population, especially among the nonhuman community, and among immigrants without a bloodline tying to the initial colonists. Outer colonies, while often more exposed to trade, have fewer resources, and are poorly developed.

## Infrastructure

The Confederacy maintains its own network of Gateways, one of the few parts of infrastructure managed by the government, all stretching back to Gilgamesh, which has a total of 18 gateways within it. While this proved a strategic weakness during the Gaia Conflict, it has also allowed Terra’s continuing prosperity, and rapid trade across the Terran Confederacy’s territory.

Communication is handled by the StarLink Union, a communications corporation that was originally a nationalized business owned by the Terran Commonwealth, but which grew into its own after the transition to the Sol Central Government, and then the Terran Confederacy. Quantum Entanglement communications are expensive, meaning that much correspondence is transferred using courier vessels.

## Resources

While not located in a particularly dense stellar region, the Terran Confederacy has a number of useful resources within its borders, both mineral and otherwise. Terra, the capital of the Confederacy is a “super earth,” a rocky planet with a significantly larger size than earth. Verdant even before colonization, jungles and forests have been replaced with a vast agricultural apparatus, producing food imported by more than half of the Confederacy. 

One of the inner Confederate systems, Hladan Kresenya has unusually plentiful heavy metals, which supplies a robust industrial apparatus. Additionally, multiple large gas giants provide vast amounts of Helium-3 for fusion reactors and laser weaponry. Independent Human powers that don’t wish to do business with SolGov often buy raw materials from the Confederacy, making several member states fairly prosperous. 

The Confederacy does not contain any deposits of Phoron, although its proximity to Nyx suggests that there may be some within its reach, as yet undiscovered. Pursuit of Phoron, either solid or gaseous, has been a cornerstone of the Terran Confederacy’s exploration program.

The remains of a large cylindrical spacecraft were discovered in a system within the Confederacy in 2557. After examination by Confederate scientists, it was determined to be non-human in origin. It had heavy pitting damage consistent with exposure to bluespace, meaning that large portions of the vessel were gone, the interior sections were fused and gutted, and little organic residue remained, even a carbon-dating could not be performed reliably. The hull of the vessel is made from a metal with unusual thermal properties, and despite its poor condition, has given Confederate scientists much to work with. Scientists from the rest of Human society, as well as some Skrell have been permitted to examine the craft, but haven’t been given access to any samples or confederate data. Concerns about the effects this craft will have on the Confederacy’s stealth program have circulated through the Defense Forces, but without concrete intelligence to take action on.
