## Overview
The Terran Confederacy is a union of independent human colonies spread over a wide region between Resomi and SolGov space. Living conditions and systems of government vary widely across the Confederacy because of its loose, federalist system of control, however most colonies have joined the Confederacy as an alternative to membership in the Sol Central Government, or for protection.

## History
* **Founded**: 31 July 2443

The origin of the Terran Confederacy has its roots in humanity’s first colonization wave, during the late 23rd century. Before Bluespace drives and Gateways, exploration and early colonization was only possible with generational ships, and cryogenically frozen crews, journeys which took decades to reach their destinations, even at near-light speeds.

One of the first such fleets was sponsored exclusively by the Terran Commonwealth, shortly after its victory in the colony conflicts, and was tasked to explore and settle a dense solar system, Gilgamesh, almost 40 light years away, on the outer edge of a large star cluster. Constructed over the course of a decade, the fleet of about two dozen sleeper ships of various sizes departed in 2280. The fleet was led by the Confucius, the most advanced starship to date, and though it would be dwarfed by the arkships later used by Project Ptolemy, it alone carried 20 thousand of the approximately 300 thousand colonists taking part in the expedition. After slipping past the edge of the solar system, the fleet left effective communication range with Earth, and within ten years, even basic status messages ceased. 

52 years later, in 2331, the fleet arrived at its destination. While four ships had been lost along the way, either due to malfunctions, or the cruel hazards of space, the other 21 vessels and 325,672 colonists had arrived safely, and quickly set to work charting their new home. Under the authority of the pre-established Provincial Commonwealth Government, the fleet split up, and began the process of exploring Gilgamesh. The first two planets surveyed were already known to be favorable for colonization before the trip began, the largest, Ameranth Major, was a so-called “super-Earth” with a mass larger than Earth, and a vibrant ecosystem already present. Surveys revealed that most of the flora and fauna on the planet was safe for human consumption, and barring a few unusually large predatory species, was an excellent site for colonization. The second planet, Ameranth Minor was also within the goldilocks zone, but had a more arid climate, and was largely covered in grasslands, multiple large oceans, and tropical forests. Closer to the system’s star, Gilgamesh, were three rocky planets, two of which were devoid of life, and blasted by the sun, but rich in minerals. However the third, Novaya Zemlya, was closer to the goldilocks zone, and was livable, if only in atmospheric domes and hazard suits. Several other planets and moons were flagged for development, and the fleet got to work establishing a society.

About 150,000 colonists made up the population of the capital on Ameranth Major, and the rest spread out across the system, setting up habitats and outposts with as many as thousands of colonists and as few as a dozen. While much of the colonization fleet was dismantled to provide initial resources for construction, eight ships were preserved, and were eventually joined by newly constructed vessels in order to ferry supplies and patrol the system.

Development moved slowly at first, but by the time the Terran Commonwealth caught up to the colonists in 2398, the Gilgamesh system was home to a population of almost a million, spread over four planets, eighteen moons, and many smaller installations. Bolstered by the bluespace-drive equipped ships of the Commonwealth, the system boomed, and along with Tau Ceti, became the bustling hub of the frontier. 

However, Earth was not quite how the colonists had left it, the Terran Commonwealth was growing quickly, and assumed a role of primacy over the outer colonies. The old provincial government was combined with Commonwealth representatives, and began taking orders from Sol. While this was not initially a problem for the locals, the influx of colonists was. Almost half a billion colonists arrived in Gilgamesh over the course of a decade, and by the time first contact was made with the Skrell in 2406, Gilgamesh was becoming overpopulated. On Ameranth Minor especially, the grasslands had been replaced with cities and habitats. Many of the descendents of the original inhabitants saw their old luxuries and ways of life disappear before their eyes. 

Gilgamesh did not take this sitting down, and after fierce debate, the Commonwealth allowed the provincial government to begin expansion into other systems in order to alleviate the strain on resources. Novaya Zemlya was transformed into an industrial hub to facilitate this expansion, producing fuel, raw materials, and equipment on the ground that were ferried to the shipyards in orbit. Gilgamesh rapidly became home to one of the larger fleets in human space, and even produced some ships that were sent back to Sol for use in the Commonwealth fleet. 

This brought unwanted attention however in the form of Skrell observers, scientists, and colonists, curious to see the distant side of Human space, much to the distaste of the locals. Unexposed to non-humans, those in Gilgamesh looked on Skrell with at best suspicion, and more often barely concealed disgust. As Sol encouraged cooperation and unity, Gilgamesh was hoping for solitude and a chance to expand. More and more the government on Earth was looking like a foreign power. 
By 2436, when the Sol Central Government Charter is signed, the provincial government was essentially an autonomous state within the Terran Commonwealth. It had its own fleet, government, and a growing population to take care of. Like all other human colonies, Gilgamesh was given a choice to join the new government when it began in 2437, unlike the other human colonies, Gilgamesh chose to become independent. The Provincial Commonwealth Government, after a referendum by its constituents voted to remain outside of SolGov, causing ripples in the fledgling union. Back in Gilgamesh, those in charge found themselves at the head of over a billion humans, spread over a number of solar systems. The need to devise a new system of government was critical, especially considering the size of their new holdings. The provincial government established a series of independent colonies, coordinated and managed by a central government, the “Terran Confederacy,” less intrusive than the old commonwealth, but still united in defense and trade. The Confederacy’s capital would be the largest, and most prosperous colony: Ameranth Major, now dubbed “Terra” in honor of homeworlds past. Delegates from each of the Gilgamesh colonies and their neighboring systems signed the Confederate Constitution in 2443, on the 31st of July, and shortly thereafter the Confederate Parliament was founded.

Cut off from the previously plentiful support of Earth, the Confederacy had to rebuild its economy to be self sustaining. Thanks to a strong manufacturing base, the Confederate Navy was able to fill the void left by the Commonwealth fleet. Goods and colonists flowed freely between the systems, and within a decade, two more systems had been founded, and joined the Confederacy. Additionally, about a dozen other colonies, habitats, and stations decided to join the Confederacy instead of SolGov. Commerce was less regulated in confederate space, attracting several growing megacorporations, and helping fuel growth, at the expense of many of the lowest members of society.

By the turn of the century in 2500, the Confederacy encompassed over 30 star systems, and more than ten billion inhabitants, including a large number of non-human laborers hired by corporations within the confederacy. A single currency, the Confederate Credit, or FedCred, allowed trade and business to flourish. The Confederacy even built and maintained its own gateway network. The Confederate Navy was larger, and more advanced than its counterpart, the Solgov fleet, and with it the Confederacy felt secure in its power, and starting in the 2530s, it began to test its limits. The Confederacy began with minor land grabs, confederate ships establishing border outposts unaffiliated with any member colony, independent habitats and worlds were pressured into joining the Confederacy, as an alternative to sharing resources with SolGov, and rubbing shoulders with aliens. While industry kept up with growth, food production did not, and after a particularly poor harvest on Terra in 2442, rationing went into effect to prevent starvation. 

The next year, in 2543, the Terran Confederacy annexed Gaia, an agriworld with a population of almost two billion, in order to secure its natural wealth, and create a buffer against another famine. While a referendum on Gaia supported confederate membership, media outlets in the Sol Central Government accused the Confederacy of meddling. Gaia, though it had willingly given up SolGov membership in 2539, still had many ties to the SCG, and fierce debate broke out in the Assemblies. Public sentiment on Gaia turned against the Confederacy in 2545, when confederate soldiers supervising food collection for shipment offworld opened fire on protesters, killing 60. Riots flared up across the planet, and martial law was declared. Media reports of the violence inflamed the situation back on Mars, and the Assemblies voted for military action to uphold the Charter. Curtailed by the Secretary-General at the time, the Defense Forces were initially not prepared for a sustained conflict, especially not with an advanced fleet like the Confederate Navy. Units were mixed between member states, and a lack of coordination meant that the Confederacy saw early success. 

Confederate forces entered SolGov space in 2546, and attacked multiple systems on the frontier before arriving at a system with a major gateway within it. Poised to break into SolGov proper, a small garrison fleet led by then-Captain John Diwali was the only thing keeping the Confederacy in check. In a brutally unorthodox move, Diwali allowed the gate to fall, but left a covert team behind, hiding within an unused part of the gateway torus. When confederate forces activated and began to enter the gate, the team detonated nuclear devices, destroying the entire torus, the ships around it, and terminating the bluespace connection while almost a third of the Confederate Navy was inside. Diwali’s forces swept in behind the scattered and blind confederate vessels, and forced them from the system. The tip of their spear shattered, the Confederate Navy retreated to Gaia while a hardened and unified SolGov fleet pursued them, reclaiming lost territory along the way.

In hopes of regaining the advantage, the Confederate Navy attempted a holding action in orbit above Gaia, and mined most of the system with stealthed nuclear explosives. However recently promoted Rear Admiral Diwali once again outmaneuvered the confederate fleet, and feigned an attack on Terra itself. Quickly drawn out of the system, the Confederate Navy left Gaia undefended, and bulk of the SCG Fleet swept away the few remaining forces in orbit, assuming control of the system and its nuclear mines. By the time the Confederate Navy realized its blunder, Admiral Diwali and his forces had left Gilgamesh, and rejoined the Fleet around Gaia. The ground campaign for Gaia itself took almost five years, and despite multiple attempts to retake the system, the Confederate Navy was unable to push SolGov from the space above it. By the time Terra sued for peace in 2550, the Navy was a broken force, little more than destroyers and frigates remained. The Confederate Army surrendered, and both organizations were dismantled. Gaia has since rejoined the Sol Central Government, along with a number of other systems previously belonging to the Confederacy. 

Today, the Terran Confederacy broods. Wounded, and defanged, but not destroyed, it has been attempting to salvage what economic and military might it had, and debate continues within Parliament as to whether or not a more centralized, powerful government is needed. SolGov maintains a close watch on its border with the Confederacy, and recently has begun a buildup of spacecraft and personnel in response to the Confederacy’s reactivation of the shipyards above Novaya Zemlya. In general, the citizens of the Confederacy are discontent, blaming SolGov or nonhumans for their worsening living conditions and economy. 

## Government and Politics

As the name suggests, the Terran Confederacy is a Semi-Presidential Confederacy, with a comparatively weak central government to SolGov, and strong member states. The primary body of the central government is the Confederate Parliament. Seated on Terra, the Confederate Parliament consists of an Upper and Lower House. The Upper House, the more senior body, seats three delegates from each member state. The Lower House seats delegates in proportion to the population of member states, giving priority to more industrial planets, like those in Gilgamesh. Parliament is led by the Prime Minister, who is elected from the body of the Upper House by both houses. As the head of government the Prime Minister manages the day to day running and operations of the Parliament, as well as general functions of the government. The Speaker of the Confederacy is elected by popular vote by citizens of member states, and acts as a Head of State, and formerly head of the armed forces. The Speaker of the Confederacy also is tasked with diplomacy and international relations, according to the will of the people. In recent years however, the Speaker of the Confederacy has been mobilizing confederate citizens to vote for increases in government power.

Because of the strong rights of member states granted by the Confederate Constitution, Parliament is limited to a set number of functions: resolving legal disputes between member states, making treaties with outside powers, managing internal and external trade, maintaining a standard currency, and other logistical requirements of running a government. While the Speaker of the Confederacy used to be the chief of the Confederate Armed Forces, and the Parliament managed them, the treaty signed with SolGov after the Gaia Conflict forbids the Confederacy from maintaining a standing military force, individual member states are now responsible for their own defense, with joint military action taking the place of a unified military.

### Foreign Relations

As a government, the Confederacy is a largely insular body, engaging in trade with trans-stellars, and independent human powers, but otherwise keeping to its own devices. While some immigration does take place, individual members may permit or deny entry as they see fit. The largest nonhuman denomination is Skrell, largely confined to merchants and corporate employees. Tajara can also be found in larger-than-average numbers because of Ahdomai’s proximity to the Confederacy. The Confederacy does have formal diplomatic contacts with those regional powers that are interested in such things, SolGov included, though rarely use diplomatic pressure to achieve their goals.

Prior to the Gaia Conflict, alongside regular applications to join the Confederacy, member states would often annex bordering colonies, habitats, and territory for a variety of reasons, some more legitimate than others. Currently however, regional ambitions have been tame, with some outlying systems joining SolGov, or going neutral.

* Sol Central Government: Formal Diplomatic Contact. Citizens of SolGov must apply for Visas to enter any Confederate Territory. Poorly maintained trade stations exist on the border where free movement is permitted. The Confederacy is currently under the terms of a peace treaty with the SCG, forbidding a standing military, the operation of military shipyards, and mandating regular aid payments to a number of systems affected by the Gaia Conflict. Continued adherence to the treaty is ensured by regular visits by SolGov Observers.
* FTU/Corporate space: Amicable relationship. While some SolGov member states avoid trade with the Confederacy for the sake of appearances, many unaffiliated corporations and FTU businesses trade regularly with the Confederacy. With a largely self sufficient basic economy, luxury goods and advanced technology are the most desired products from the rest of human space.
* Skrell City-States: Formal diplomatic contact. Skrell are permitted entry and residency to the Confederacy with visas, however not all individual member states permit Skrell entry.
* Dionaea Gestalts: No contact.
* Vox Shoals: No formal contact. Minor raids have occurred, but no large scale Vox action has occured in confederate space.
* Ahdomai: Formal diplomatic contact. Cold relations due to the status of Tajara in confederate society, however some member states make great use of Tajaran labor.
* Moghes Hegemony: No contact.
* The Positronic Union: No formal contact. Positronic brains are imported by the Confederacy, but are not known to be manufactured within its borders.
* The Fury of Mankind: The Confederacy quietly supports a number of anti-nonhuman movements, and other anarchical or anti-government organizations in SolGov space, the FoM included. 

### Defense and Law Enforcement

Before 2550, the Terran Confederacy had a standing military, consisting of a Navy and Army for operation in space and planetside respectively. In the early 2500s, the Confederate Armed forces were considered the strongest standing military force in human space. When the Confederacy went to war with SolGov, the SCG had major disadvantages in both manpower and technology, resulting in significant early losses. However, after the resolution of the Gaia Conflict, the remains Confederate Military were dismantled, with most vessels and materiel being scrapped or sold to pay for war reparations. Today, individual member states provide for their own defense, with military ability varying depending on location. In times of need, the Confederacy is permitted by its treaty with SolGov to assemble a combined force with member state resources and troops. Because of the moratorium of military shipyards within the Confederacy, many vessels are poorly equipped, or hand-me-downs purchased from corporate asset protection forces. While some individual forces, such as the Terran Guard in Gilgamesh, may be of high quality, most member states only have numbers to rely on.

Law enforcement is handled by individual member states, with some laws varying widely depending on location. Disputes between member states are handled by the Confederate Tribunal, a temporary body formed when needed by randomly selected members of Parliament. Extradition treaties are common between members, but not universal, with some member states being known has havens for fleeing criminals. The Terran Confederacy does have a basic legal code within its Constitution, but it is only used during disputes between members, now that its standing military has been dissolved. 

## Territory

The Terran Confederacy currently encompasses 97 member states, spread over 34 systems, spread in a generally spherical pattern around Gilgamesh, and situated between SolGov and Resomi space. While some member states do encompass entire planets, many are smaller colonies, both planetside, or dug into asteroids. It has almost a dozen corporate members, but only one could be considered a Trans-Stellar: HelTek Arms, a weapons and spacecraft manufacturer headquartered in orbit around Novaya Zemlya. 

HelTek isn’t a popular brand in SolGov due to sanctions stemming from the Gaia Conflict, but their products are commonly seen in the inventories of private security companies and frontier law enforcement personnel because of their rugged designs and ease of use. Surplus HelTek STS-35s built during the prelude to the war with SolGov can still be bought unused in many less-than-legal markets.

### Resources

While not located in a particularly dense stellar region, the Terran Confederacy has a number of useful resources within its borders, both mineral and otherwise. Terra, the capital of the Confederacy is a “super earth,” a rocky planet with a significantly larger size than earth. Verdant even before colonization, jungles and forests have been replaced with a vast agricultural apparatus, producing food imported by more than half of the Confederacy. 

One of the inner Confederate systems, Hladan Kresenya has unusually plentiful heavy metals, which supplies a robust industrial apparatus. Additionally, multiple large gas giants provide vast amounts of Helium-3 for fusion reactors and laser weaponry. Independent Human powers that don’t wish to do business with SolGov often buy raw materials from the Confederacy, making several member states fairly prosperous. 

The Confederacy does not contain any deposits of Phoron, although its proximity to Nyx suggests that there may be some within its reach, as yet undiscovered. Pursuit of Phoron, either solid or gaseous, has been a cornerstone of the Terran Confederacy’s exploration program.

The remains of a large cylindrical spacecraft were discovered in a system within the Confederacy in 2557. After examination by Confederate scientists, it was determined to be non-human in origin. It had heavy pitting damage consistent with exposure to bluespace, meaning that large portions of the vessel were gone, the interior sections were fused and gutted, and little organic residue remained, even a carbon-dating could not be performed reliably. The hull of the vessel is made from a metal with unusual thermal properties, and despite its poor condition, has given Confederate scientists much to work with. Scientists from the rest of Human society, as well as some Skrell have been permitted to examine the craft, but haven’t been given access to any samples or confederate data. Concerns about the effects this craft will have on the Confederacy’s stealth program have circulated through the Defense Forces, but without concrete intelligence to take action on.

## Motives and Beliefs

The Terran Confederacy, while made up of many separate member states, generally operates based on its official motto: Liberty, Sovereignty, Unity. Its founding members split from SolGov in order to pursue their own path, and protect their own rights. Government regulations and legal blocks are few and relatively weak, making the Confederacy attractive to people, corporations, and governments who wish to go their own way, outside the prying eyes of a big brother. As a largely human organization, the Confederacy and its member states prioritize defense against their Resomi neighbors over internal defense, and are constantly on alert for SolGov interference in their space. While individual member states may disagree, and even fight on occasion, if an external threat were to arise, the Confederacy would unite to repel it. 

## Culture
Terran culture is as varied as it is in most of human space. While many customs and traditions were carried from Earth, especially from the homelands of the original colonists, culture and lifestyle varies widely depending on location.

### Entertainment

While largely similar to other Human organizations, there is one entertainment event in the Confederacy that has spread beyond its borders in a large way: Thunderdome. Originally envisioned as a way to formally resolve duels, Thunderdome has flourished into a reborn form of gladiatorial combat. While it has been officially denounced by the Assemblies, Thunderdome is popular in many member states that allow its broadcast, and even more watched on the frontier, outside of SolGov space.

Thunderdome matches can range from organized bouts using a single martial art, and only fighting to a pre-agreed on number of downs, to no-holds-barred deathmatches using energy weapons. Generally agreed upon is that thunderdome matches take place between two or more consensual competitors, typically in a standardized court, a circular dome with slatted sides for climbing, although special events and matches use nonstandard courts, or take place over natural terrain.

Thunderdome duels still are permitted in some confederate member states, and participants have an option to broadcast these duels, granting the winner prize money. Most common however, are standard team matches, with 6 individuals on each side, armed either with a standardized melee weapon, or with weapons that can be found on the court.

## Economy
* **Imports**: Phoron. Bluespace Drives. Luxury Goods. Plant Genes. Positronics. Foodstuffs.
* **Exports**: Raw Materials. Industrial Equipment. Weaponry. Spacecraft. Helium-3


The Confederacy’s most prosperous member states tend to be industrial, focusing on spacecraft design, mining, or producing consumer goods like machinery and vehicles. The Confederacy is one of the largest exporters of equipment for fledgling colonies, with the exception of terraforming equipment. 

Because of a growing population, the Terran Confederacy has increased its purchases of food from outside the Confederacy, however many in SolGov are unwilling to sell to confederate buyers because of the Gaia Conflict. 

As previously mentioned, there is only one Trans-Stellar Corporation based fully within the Confederacy, HelTek Arms provides equipment to most member states, as well as many third parties and external factions. Other notable corporations include Almeida Corporation, a home supply and furnishing corporation known for its easy to assemble designs, and popular line of fabricators and lathes for use in colony construction, and CarryQuick Delivery.

Because of the separated nature of confederate members, there is no unified shipping or postal service, a niche filled by CarryQuick, which is responsible for most interstellar freight within the Confederacy.

While many confederate citizens enjoy a greater level of individual prosperity than the average SolGov citizen, there is a greater proportion of poverty within the population, especially among the nonhuman community, and among immigrants without a bloodline tying to the initial colonists. Outer colonies, while often more exposed to trade, have fewer resources, and are poorly developed.

## Infrastructure

The Confederacy maintains its own network of Gateways, one of the few parts of infrastructure managed by the government, all stretching back to Gilgamesh, which has a total of 18 gateways within it. While this proved a strategic weakness during the Gaia Conflict, it has also allowed Terra’s continuing prosperity, and rapid trade across the Terran Confederacy’s territory.

Communication is handled by the StarLink Union, a communications corporation that was originally a nationalized business owned by the Terran Commonwealth, but which grew into its own after the transition to the Sol Central Government, and then the Terran Confederacy. Quantum Entanglement communications are expensive, meaning that much correspondence is transferred using courier vessels.

## Science and Technology
Overall, confederate technology is similar to technology in the rest of society, and considering the flow of goods and technology, this is unsurprising. Many member states lag behind in some areas, depending on the level of development. Most notably, the Terran Confederacy is unable to build its own positronic brains, and a lack of Phoron prevents the construction of Bluespace drives and use of Phoron-based medications.

More developed confederate members tend to outpace their SolGov peers in shipbuilding, and heavy industry. Confederate machinery is more rugged and dependable, if not as user friendly and sleek as SolGov-built equipment. Confederate military vessels, when they were still built in Gilgamesh, were second to none, and the reactivation of the shipyards above Novaya Zemlya has PMCs and colonial defense forces giddy in anticipation.

Of special note is the stealth technology the Terran Confederacy equips its spacecraft with. Advanced thermal dissipation and jamming technology, alongside hulls made from metamaterial alloys give confederate spacecraft, habitats, and weaponry a significant edge over their adversaries, or at least did while they were still made. 

## Hazards and Crime

The Terran Confederacy is not a soft place. Laws favor states, and citizens over visitors, and citizens of SolGov are advised to tread softly. Outer member states tend to be similarly dangerous to frontier colonies, law is maintained by local forces, and only to the point enforced by individuals. A town sheriff is just as likely to shoot you for your trouble as they are to put you in front of a judge. There are a few established gangs, pirates, and mercenary groups, and less-than-legal business is easy to find in many areas, member states to look the other way if criminals do most of their damage outside of their borders.

Nonhumans are particularly disadvantaged, with many member states not only denying citizenship on the basis of species, but outright denying them legal protection. Tajara especially are seen in a negative light due to their homeworld’s proximity, and reputation for taking good industrial jobs. Nonhumans are more accepted closer to Gilgamesh, but one could never call the Confederacy friendly to anyone but humans.

## Restricted Information

In the waning months of 2559, a SolGov Fleet vessel carrying a number of sapient rights observers on a routine survey of the Terran Confederacy disappeared while returning to SolGov. Publicly, this vessel was destroyed in a tragic Bluespace Drive accident. In actuality, the vessel was attacked by advanced spacecraft belonging to the Confederacy. The vessel managed to take refuge aboard a corporate space station outside confederate space, and despite the ensuing loss of that station and the vessel, at least one survivor managed to carry a report back to SolGov. That report revealed that the persecution of nonhumans in the Confederacy was much more than initially believed. The observers had stumbled upon a labor camp entirely staffed by nonhumans. These nonhumans were being forced to process an unknown mineral in barely survivable conditions. 

The observers were unable to discover if the operation was directly supported by the Confederate Parliament, but due to the response of unregistered Confederate Military, it suggests that the operation is likely endorsed, and may be larger than observed. Later attempts to gather intel on the site found that it had been destroyed from orbit, and closer examination remains impossible due to an increased military presence in that system. Many in the Defense Forces consider another conflict inevitable, however the Secretary-General wishes to avoid war if at all possible. For the time being, information about this development has remained classified, for fear of actions that other organizations, especially nonhuman governments, would take if they learned of it.

High level intel reports by the Office of Interstellar Intelligence caution that in addition to the labor camps, rumors continue to circulate of a renewed interest in stealth technology within the higher circles of confederate government, and believe that information gleaned from the damaged spacecraft discovered in ‘57 have aided the Confederacy in creating a new stealth alloy. As a result, increased research into sensor technology has been quietly funded by SolGov.

## Notable People, Places, and Things

### Charles Turner, Speaker of the Confederacy
Born on Novaya Zemlya to a pair of industrial laborers, Charles Turner grew up intimately familiar with hardship. He rose from poverty by enlisting in the Confederate Army, and by the time the Gaia Conflict was over, held the rank of Major, having been promoted meritoriously for actions throughout the war. Upon returning to civilian life after the military was disbanded, Turner felt betrayed by the Parliament for their surrender, and decided to enter politics in order to change things. After becoming a popular representative, Turner ran for Speaker, and was elected by a significant margin. Considered by many Confederates to be a hero, Turner has focused his attention on strengthening parliament, and the central confederate government, as well as reactivating much of the old military industrial complex.

### Maelstrom Shipyards and Foundry, Novaya Zemlya Orbit
Orbiting Novaya Zemlya, the Maelstrom Shipyards and Foundry is the largest spacecraft manufacturing complex in human space. A massive construction, the shipyard contains mineral processing plants, industrial fabrication centers, and massive berths for constructing everything from drones to supercarriers. Largely shut down after the Gaia Conflict due to damage and the treaty with SolGov, it has been reactivated as of 2560.

### The Obelisk, Terran Orbit
A massive slab of black marble native to Ameranth Minor, the Obelisk is a monument to the men and women who gave their lives for the Confederacy during the Gaia Conflict. Measuring exactly 250 meters in height, an entire side is taken up by those lost inside and around a gateway when SolGov forces destroyed it with nuclear weapons. It is regularly visited for memorial services, and has become a symbol for Speaker Turner’s push to strengthen the Confederacy. One of the better guarded orbital features in Terra, it is kept in orbit by a small service station attached to its base.
