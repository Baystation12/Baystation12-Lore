# Economic Mission: 

[Link back to Sol Gov](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/Sol/Sol-Gov)

The Committee for Economic Development is responsible for managing the monetary interaction of colonies and corporations. It ensures the free travel of goods, services, people, and fiscal capital. It is the regulatory body responsible for maintaining the Thaler, investigating fraud between member states, establishing safe trade routes, preventing the sale and transport of contraband across the gateway network, and ensuring the stability of the interstellar economy. As instant communication between systems is still expensive if it's required to be quicker and more detailed than a basic black and white fax, so the CED is responsible for maintaining communication channels, especially the stock market, which would be almost impossible to coordinate without the SolGov quantum communication arrays across human space. Organizations managed by the CED include the **Bureau of Natural Resources**, the **Gateway Administration**, the **Customs and Trade Bureau**, the **Bureau of Energy**, the **Solar Bank**, the **Bureau of Finance**, the **Astronomical Society**, the **Census Bureau**, the **Patent and Trademark Office**, the **Communications Bureau**, the **Interstellar Postal Service**, and the **Bureau of Research**.

## Gateway Administration:

One of the most understated, but vital parts of SolGov, the Gateway Administration manages the construction and operation of all Gateways in SolGov territory. While several contracting companies do most of the hard labor, the GA ensures all gateways are built to the exacting standards required, and then keeps them running properly and safely.

## Customs and Trade Bureau: 

Agents of the Customs and Trade Bureau run customs checks at most gateways, and are typically involved in raids on smuggling operations and the like. However they also do the more mundane tasks of shipping, like inspecting and labeling interstellar freight.

## Solar Bank: 

The Solar Bank provides several essential banking services to SolGov and its member states. Not only does it provide insured banking to SolGov citizens, and humans without any citizenship, it provides loans to struggling states and organizations for humanitarian purposes. Most importantly, it works with the Bureau of Finance to regulate the Thaler and its value.

The Thaler (T, code THL) is the official currency recognized by the Sol Gov. It is the most common currency used in Sol Central-space and its territories, and it is the most popular currency for international or interplanetary transactions. The Thaler is the most dominant currency used by the Free Trade Union, although the organization does not restrict the use of alternate currencies in its jurisdiction.

The value of the Thaler is defined by a Sol Central document published by the organization's economics committee and approved by a joint vote in both the Solar and Colonial assemblies.

## Interstellar Postal Service: 

While they may seem at times antiquated, the public courier services provided by the IPS are essential. Even with private options available, many still send packages and sensitive communication via the ships of the IPS.
