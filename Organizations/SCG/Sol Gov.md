# Big Brother and the Government

With Civilization comes laws, government, and power. The things that, inherently, make civilization civilization, and not barbarianism.
Each of the stellar species has their own government, one in control of the mass majority of their populations, and humanity is no 
different.
Out there in the stars, the great arms of the Sol Central Government, extend beyond Humanity's home system, finding new stars, establishing order, and attempting to bring peace to chaos. How does it work? well lets see.

# The Sol Central Government

* **Capital**: Olympus, Mars
* **Government**: Cooperative Federal Republic
* **Head of Government**: Secretary-General Amaya Borros
* **Population**: Approximately 60 Billion
* **Official Language**: None, Sol Common(Informal), Galactic Common(Informal)
* **Demonym**: Solars, Informally based on Colonial Citizenship
* **Created by**: Raptor1628


The Sol Central Government, commonly referred to as SolGov, the SCG, or Sol Central is a federal republic composed of numerous human 
states across many solar systems, which governs, directly or indirectly, the majority of human space. Its primary governing bodies are
the Assemblies, which are in turn led by a Secretary-General, who is elected by the Assemblies. Member states have a great degree of
freedom in their actions, while the SCG manages sapient rights, security, the economy, and diplomacy for humanity as a whole. It has a
diverse population, including many non-humans, and encompasses a wide range of systems, territories, habitats, and stellar bodies. The
Sol Central Government and its member states make up one of the more advanced and powerful civilizations in the known galaxy.

Founded from the Terran Commonwealth decades ago, Sol Gov has a long history of political turmoil and war.

## How Does it Work?

The assemblies largely form a basis for diplomacy and trade across human space, managing economic agreements, mining and environmental concerns, and ensuring Sapient Rights are upheld. For example, during the Synthetic Intelligence Rights Crisis of 2558, both the Solar and Colonial Assemblies declared Posibrains to be sapient, and therefore protected by the Universal Declaration of Rights.

While member states manage affairs that fall under SolGov's jurisdiction within their own borders, including trade agreement and diplomacy between individual member states; gateways and the spaces between states are SolGov's jurisdiction, and any SolGov personnel and outposts within a member state are considered immune from that state's laws. SolGov's main presence can be found on most colonies and stations in the form of aid missions and schools, in space protecting gateways and establishing navigational beacons in nebulae, and even on the frontier, as Colonial Marshals track down criminals that have fled from SolGov administered systems to what they think is safe anonymity. Most of SolGov's revenue comes from taxes on the use of its gateways, communication systems, and secure trade routes, typically higher for non-members, as well as regular funding by corporations and individual member states. While SolGov has no say over legal interactions between member states, it is permitted by its charter to negotiate with other political entities, human or otherwise. While the many organizations of SolGov are staffed by SolGov citizens, member states often send their own personnel to serve and gain experience.

### The Charter

*The Sol Central Government Charter is the foundational treaty of the Sol Central Government. It was signed at the Palace of Nations in Geneva, on Earth, by the Terran Commonwealth and the founding members of the SCG on 12 November 2436. It went into effect on the first day of 2437, and marked the start of a new chapter in Humanity's history. The Charter defines the workings of the Sol Central Government, codifies its laws, and organizes its members. Functioning both as a constitution and a binding treaty, the Charter is what grants the SCG its powers and responsibilities. All states that have ratified the Charter must abide by it, or risk sanctions, punishments, and even expulsion, though the latter has never occurred. The charter contains the legal code of the Sol Central Government, largely based off of the Universal Declaration of Rights. While those human states that have not ratified the Charter do not have to abide by its rules and regulations, the SCG has enforced the Universal Declaration of Rights in non-members, though only in two extreme instances.*

## The Missions of Sol Gov

### [Economic Mission](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/SCG/SCG-Economics)

The Committee for Economic Development is responsible for managing the monetary interaction of colonies and corporations.

### [Sapientarian Mission](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/SCG/SCG-Sapience): 

Once limited to humans, the Committee for Sapientarian Development now sets its sights on ensuring basic rights for all sapient life.

### [Diplomatic Mission](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/SCG/SCG-Diplomacy): 

Once nothing more than the Committee that handles relations among member states and contact with the Skrell, it has expanded it's position with the inclusion of the Interstellar Assembly and the Expeditionary Corps' revival.

### [Peacekeeping Mission](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/SCG/SCG-Peace): 

Unlike the United Nations on Old Earth, SolGov maintains its own standing police and military forces, both under the aegis of the Committee of Defense and Security.

## People, Places, and Things

* Gateway One, Lunar Orbit: 

While the first gateway used by humanity orbited the Earth, that first gate, connecting Sol to its closest neighbor Alpha Centauri, has since been decommissioned and is now a museum. A larger, more advanced gate was constructed in a stable orbit around Luna. One of the most heavily guarded places in human space, Gateway One is the only way to enter or exit Sol without a Bluespace Drive.

* Hermes Naval Shipyard and Orbital Drydock, Venusian Orbit:

One of the largest shipyards made by humanity, the Hermes Shipyard not only provides a stable platform for constructing vessels of peace and war, but also houses the crews and corporate offices of many corporations contracted to build ships for SolGov.

* The Sol Central Government Fleet Academy, Buenos Aires, Earth:

The SCG Fleet Academy, is a four year service academy established for the purpose of educating and training young leaders for service in the Fleet as Officers. Candidates for admission must apply directly, and receive a nomination from an Assembly representative. Graduates commission as Ensigns in the Fleet, or Second Lieutenants in the Marine Corps.

* SFV Amazon: 

Flagship of the Fleet, the Amazon is an advanced Battlecarrier, designed for command and control, and carries a large complement of marines and strike craft. It remains garrisoned in Sol with the rest of First Fleet.

* SFV Terra: 

An older ship that originally belonged to the Terran Commonwealth, converted into a museum ship, kept officially on active duty for ceremonial purposes.

* SEV Torch:

Currently sitting in drydock at the Shiva Fleet Yards undergoing final preparations for its exploratory mission, the Torch is the culmination of almost a decade of negotiations and cooperation between many organizations, both inside the government and out.

* SEV Magnus:

One of the major ships in the Expeditionary Corps, it went missing during its exploration into the far outer reaches of the Trajan System.
