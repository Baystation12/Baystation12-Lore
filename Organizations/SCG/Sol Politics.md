# How Sol Gov Works

[Link back to Sol Gov](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/Sol/Sol-Gov)

The Sol Gov is a incredibly slow, super giant of a bureaucratic nightmare. Beware all those who continue to read.

## Bureaucracy is Key

### Solar Assembly

The Solar Assembly is what's left of the founding body. Any sovereign state in the Solar System with a human population of over 50,000 is eligible for membership, though two members with smaller populations remain from the original SCGB. In addition, any extrasolar states with a human population of over one billion on one body, planetary, lunar, or otherwise, is eligible for membership, though an extrasolar member hasn't been accepted in decades. While currently, Corporations based in Sol are only eligible for membership in the Colonial Assembly, a few minor corporations from the time of the SCGB remain, including Aether Atmospherics. While none of the nation-states of Earth are on the Solar Assembly, and likely won't be any time soon due to stigma and the inability to control their own borders, several do sit on the Assembly as observers. The Solar Assembly manages affairs within Sol and its largest neighbors, Tau Ceti and Centuari included. While any member of the Solar or Colonial Assemblies can propose a a peacekeeping operation, or major aid mission, only the Solar Assembly can approve it. Due to the size of both assemblies, votes are majority based.


### The Colonial Assembly

is open to any extrasolar state with a human population of over 500,000 in one system. That includes any states on a planet or moon, a union of smaller states under one banner, or even an entire allied system. Any corporation headquartered in Sol may also gain membership of the Colonial Assembly. In 2547, a radical group of Skrell separatists applied for membership in the Colonial Assembly, they were denied in order to maintain a positive relationship with the Skrell, but it sparked a debate over theoretically allowing Xeno-Sapients into SolGov in the future that has not been resolved to date. Six seats on the Colonial Assembly belong to elected representatives from the Solar Assembly, which typically change every year. While the ability to approve major military action rests with the Solar Assembly, the Colonial Assembly may veto such an action with a majority vote of more than 2/3 of the members, though this hasn't occurred yet. Organizations containing human members, but not eligible or desiring to sit on the Colonial Assembly may request observer status. The Free Trade Union is one of the most respected of the observers, due to its influence in a large swathe of human population, and it has been suggested on multiple occasions, without result, that they be given voting status, despite their lack of borders or centralized organization.

### The Secretary-General

The spokesperson and face of SolGov is the Secretary-General, who is elected by the Colonial Assembly every three years, or after a vote of no confidence by either assembly. The Secretary-General is the only individual sapient, that with no backing state or corporation, is permitted to propose resolutions or action, however they are not a voting member of either assembly.

### The High Court

Highest law in all Sol Gov. It interprets the laws of the SolGov Charter, and has the ultimate jurisdiction over lower SolGov court cases. It consists of 20 individually appointed Justices, 10 appointed by the Solar Assembly, and 10 appointed by the Colonial Assembly. A 21st member, the Supreme Justice is nominated by the Secretary-General, and must be approved by both Assemblies. Cases that go before the High Court range from evaluating the constitutionality of laws, appeals of lower court cases, intellectual property cases, major violations of the SolGov charter by states, leaders, groups, or individuals, and arbitrating conflicts between SolGov members.

### Cooperative Government, rather than Dual

SolGov's vast territory is split into several organizational Sectors, each with their own administrative centers and hierarchy. This includes Solgov Sector or Low Courts. These courts handle civil and criminal cases under SolGov's jurisdiction within their sector. This includes crimes between multiple states within a sector, or in SolGov controlled space, local commercial disputes, and appeals from local judicary bodies. While smaller colonies, habitats, and other population clusters may have their own government, legal system, and police force, if these groups live inside SolGov territory, SolGov has the ultimate jurisdiction over legal matters that aren't within a member state. Judges are elected by SolGov citizens living within a sector unaffiliated with any member state, and server terms of ten years. As there are no term limits, it's not unheard of for judges to sit until their deaths or retirement.

Member States of SolGov are permitted to exercise their own legal authority over their citizens based on their own laws, as long as those laws are within the guidelines of the SolGov charter. However, SolGov does get involved in several matters of local law. Criminals that flee State they broke the law in, and do not commit crimes in any other areas inside SolGov before their recapture, are extradited back to the State they are charged in. If a criminal is guilty of crimes in multiple States, or in SolGov territory, they will be tried in the SolGov court system, which can be appealed all the way up to the High Court. Individuals wishing to extend their trials may also appeal to SolGov courts to hear a case on whether or not the laws of the State in question violate the SolGov charter. SolGov also has the right to adjudicate cases of its own choosing, should either assembly vote that a case should be sent to the High Court. This ability is only infrequently used though, due to the heavy pushback of member states in most instances.

### Committees: 

There are a variety of committees tasked with organizing the primary missions and tasks of SolGov forces, with each committee being staffed with members from both assemblies, elected to the positions from their respective assemblies. Typically the members of a committee have some special knowledge or bearing on an institution, such as an agriworld's representative sitting on the aid committee, or a security contracting corporation sitting on the peacekeeping committee. Members are typically rotated every solar year or so, however there is no limit to sequential terms.

### Political Coalitions

Not only are there everything mentioned above, but there's the political manuervering and backstabbing nature of politicians in the 26th century through their various Coalitions. The main food groups that control the Assemblies, and many other smaller representative governments on colonies are as follow:

* [SFR](https://baystatio12.net/lore/Organizations/Political%Coalitions/SFR) – Center right/right wing.
* [SNO](https://baystatio12.net/lore/Organizations/Political%Coalitions/SNO) – Right wing/far right.
* [PAC](https://baystatio12.net/lore/Organizations/Political%Coalitions/PAC) – Center/center left.
* [UGLS](https://baystatio12.net/lore/Organizations/Political%Coalitions/UGLS) – Center left/left wing.
* [LDDF](https://baystatio12.net/lore/Organizations/Political%Coalitions/LDDF) – Far left.


### Corporations in SolGov:

While some corporations choose to stay clear of SolGov, and base their headquarters further towards the edge of human expansion, there are some benefits to being a corporate member, though those come with some downsides. Unlike states, corporations with membership in SolGov, with the exception of those in the Solar Assembly, are required to obey SolGov law, and report any violations therof. In addition, SolGov Observers are permanently installed in corporate offices that are based within a SolGov controlled gateway torus. However, corporations that are members of SolGov get access to more secure trade routes, with fewer tariffs and trade penalties. Their cargos and facilities are insured when in SolGov space. The ability to base offices and facilities within SolGov protected gateways is invaluable in lawless systems on the frontier such as Nyx. While often overlooked, free education, and cheap food from SolGov never hurt when running a Trans-Stellar corporation.

### Citizenship:

While the issue of nationality and citizenship has only grown more complex with births being possible in the void between systems, in orbit around a planet, or even in the harsh realm of bluespace, SolGov has attempted to combat this by allowing any human born to claim SolGov citizenship, or to claim the citizenship of either or both parents, if they were citizens of a SolGov member. Even humans already possessing citizenship within a member state may claim SolGov citizenship should they wish. Unemployed humans with sole citizenship of SolGov are encouraged to find employment within one of the many organizations of SolGov, but should they be unable or unwilling to work, they will be given enough food to subsist on, and a place to sleep in one of the many shelters SolGov operates.

### Membership: 

Once eligible for either assembly, human states and organizations need only petition their respective assembly and their membership will be put to a majority vote. While on several occasions, a poor Sapient Rights record, or outstanding conflict will prevent membership, most applicants are accepted in a timely manner. Non-Corporate Members of SolGov, in addition to having a say in the common direction of mankind, have more tangible economic and social benefits: access to SolGov trade routes; the ability to base facilities within gateways; military protection from aggressors, human or otherwise; access to the SolGov quantum communications network; and the promise of aid in the event of a disaster. In exchange, member states pay taxes to SolGov, pledge support, both in times of war and peace, and are subject to the SolGov charter.
