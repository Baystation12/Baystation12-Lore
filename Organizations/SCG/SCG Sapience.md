# Sapientary Mission

[Link back to Sol Gov](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/Sol/Sol-Gov)

Once limited to humans, the Committee for Sapientarian Development now sets its sights on ensuring basic rights for all sapient life. It constructs schools at all levels, from Medical Academies to Kindergartens, for communities without formalized education systems or poor access to higher learning. Hospitals and aid stations are not only present within gateway toruses, but in areas on the frontiers of member systems, or in locations that require advanced medical care. Several member states have given up thousands of square kilometers on their planets to the Sapientarian Committee for growing the food required for massive aid missions. Wherever sentients are in need within SolGov's influence, you can bet some of their people will be there trying to improve conditions. Some of the most notable parts of the CSD are the **Bureau of Observers**, the **Refugee Office**, the **Bureau of Agriculture**, the **Aid Agency**, the **Bureau of Education**, the **Interstellar Health Service**, the **Bureau of Migration**, the **Housing Agency**, and the **Bureau of Citizenship**.

## Bureau of Observers:

As the name suggests, the Bureau of Observers places and is in charge of the observers in member states, ensuring the Universal Declaration of Rights is upheld, and members are acting within their boundaries and responsibilities. Observers are also sent to non-SolGov worlds during Rights Crises and other turmoil.

## Interstellar Health Service:

The IHS is responsible for providing free and comprehensive medical care to all Sapients in SolGov space. Typically based in Gateway Toruses, SolGov installations, and in the capitals of member states. Services include complete surgical suites, prosthetic care, sleeve rejection therapy, reproductive health services, and non-human anatomy experts.

## Bureau of Citizenship: 

Currently engaged in heavy debate about allowing non-human sapients citizenship, the Bureau of Citizenship manages passports and citizenship in the complicated web of loyalties and allegiances present in SolGov. All humans wishing for general SolGov citizenship instead of their birth state or corporate sponsor may simply apply to the BoC and become a citizen of SolGov, with all the rights and assets that entails.
