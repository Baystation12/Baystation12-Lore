### The Fireteam

The most basic unit of organization for infantry, the fireteam has remain largely unchanged since its inception, although weaponry has evolved. It consists of four members: the Team Leader, the Automatic Rifleman, the Assistant Automatic Rifleman, and the Rifleman.

### Team Leader

The Team Leader, as the title suggests, leads the fireteam, typically holding Corporal ranks. The Team leader maneuvers the team based on orders coming from above. The team leader often has a compact weapon, such as the standard pulse carbine, paired with a grenade launcher or laser cannon, and acts as the fireteam grenadier.

### Automatic Rifleman

The primary source of fire for the fireteam, "Automatic Rifleman" has become something of an artifact title, with "Gunner" becoming more common in some units. Regardless of the name, the Automatic Rifleman provides suppressive and effective fire for the fireteam, seeking to pin the enemy so that they can be killed. While the most common weapon used is the Heavy Automatic Pulse Rifle, other automatic weapons can be used by specialized units. The Automatic Rifleman is often the second-in-command of a fireteam, and takes over in the event of the Team Leader's death. Many automatic riflemen in the modern infantry fireteam are equipped with a hardsuit, providing force multiplication, and secondary heavy weapons such as pulse cannons, rockets, and railguns.

### Assistant Automatic Rifleman

The Assistant Automatic Rifleman supports the Automatic Rifleman in their primary task: producing casualties. They carry extra power cells and equipment for the Squad Automatic Weapon, as well as extra medical equipment beyond the standard lifesaving kit. They are fully trained in the operation of the SAW, and can take over in the event of the Automatic Rifleman's death.

### Rifleman

The most junior member of the fireteam, the Rifleman fills the role of team marksman, often equipped with a pulse rifle or other battle rifle. In close quarter battle (CQB), the Rifleman takes the hazardous position of point, and often exchanges a rifle for a more maneuverable weapon.

## Light Infantry vs. Heavy Infantry vs. Mechanized Infantry

### Light Infantry

Light Infantry are the most common units in modern ground forces, and would not look completely unfamilar to veterans of the wars of the 21st and 22nd centuries. Typically at least equipped with fully enclosed armor, Marines and other space-based infantry wear voidsuits, and have a hardsuit-equipped Automatic Rifleman. Light Infantry are versatile, and can move quickly, but have some vulnerabilities without heavier support.

### Heavy Infantry

Heavy Infantry on the other hand are deadly with support and on their own. Universally equipped with hardsuits, most roles are significantly up-armed in addition to added armor. Most individuals carry weaponry that would be equivalent to the Light Infantry SAW, and the the "Automatic Rifleman" position is often filled with a mechsuit, with the assistant acting as a mobile repair and resupply technician. Heavy Infantry is more expensive to field, and also has drawbacks in the form of a greater dependence on regular resupply, and limited mobility in structures.

### Mechanized Infantry

Mechanized Infantry operate more like a unit of armor than a fireteam, and are able to devastate the enemy using mechsuits. Still operating in units for four, mechanized infantry rarely operate independently, and are often attached to other units, especially when in use on space stations or in other vessels. On a planet's surface however, the smaller mechsuits for use in space give way to the formidable planetary suits. Mechanized infantry add an extra punch to infantry advances, a formidable garrison or peacekeeping unit, and a finer touch to mechanized cavalry and armor units.
