The Defense Forces of Sol Gov can be separted into a few categories:

## [The Fleet](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/SCG/DF/Fleet)

The Fleet is the backbone of the SGDF. It maintains border sovereignty while also combatting piracy and insurgents. It is the most commonly seen branch, and in recent years has built up significantly, more strictly patrolling borders and trade lanes in the wake of the Gaia Conflict.

## [The Marines](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/SCG/DF/Marines)

The Marine Corps, now a separate branch from the Fleet, operates in tandem with the Fleet. It maintains security on Fleet vessels and acts as a quick response force to crises within SolGov borders.

## [The Army](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/SCG/DF/Army)

The SolGov Army is a standing force primarily made up of reserves, equipped for traditional ground warfare, as well as planetside naval operations. Currently it maintains a small force due to warfare predominantly taking place in space.

## [Infantry Organization](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/SCG/DF/MIO)

From largest to smallest, the infantry unit is organized from Division, to Brigade, to Regiment, to Battalion, to Company, to Platoon, to Squad, to Fireteam. Typically, each unit has three of the next largest unit within it, alongside various support units. For example: a platoon contains three squads, and a command element, and a squad contains three fireteams, and a squad leader. In Aviaton, Cavalry, or Armor units, vehicles or aircraft tend to replace individual fireteam units, but otherwise operate similarly. While in an operation, bits and pieces of units are often mixed, in order to provide a full range of capabilities to marines and soldiers on the ground.
