# Sol Central Government Fleet(SCGF)

## 1st Fleet (Reserve):

 A mainly ceremonial force after the creation of the Home Guard, the First Fleet is permanently garrisoned in Sol, and is where all new fleet vessels are assigned until they are sent to another unit. The First Fleet does occasionally send individual vessels or groups of vessels for Public Relations missions, ceremonies, or to escort dignitaries between Sol and other systems.

## 4th Fleet:

 Specifically assigned to secure the border of Skrell space, and the space that separates the Resomi Empire from humanity, the Fourth Fleet is sometimes considered the place where slackers are sent to languish, as officially they are only protecting the Skrell border. While this reputation may have been true to an extent, recent tensions have caused an overhaul of Fourth Fleet. With many incompetent or ineffective officers having been shown the door, Fourth Fleet may have to prove its mettle before long.
