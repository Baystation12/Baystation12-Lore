# A Short Unathi History

Moghes was once a massive jungle of a world, with the poles and mountain ranges being the coldest places to find on the strange world. The Precursors were a different people to the Unathi of today, and were a far more aggressive species than the Unathi of today, which is surprising with how aggressive the Unathi themselves are. The Precursors had the technological level of mid-21st Century Earth before the near total extinction of life on the planet.

Cities were massive hubs, looking like the favels of Rio de Janeiro in the 21st century, with the functionality of a city armed to the teeth. Due to the warring of the different states, nuclear warheads launched across the world and knocked the world back a peg or seven.

Irradiation and evolution over hundreds and hundreds of years lead to the present day Unathi, a traditional, aggressive, reptilian people of a dying world. However, this crippled their technology and left then with a harsh environment with little population, radiation, and lack of clean water and food. This paved the way for the current Unathi lifestyle.

Most general history assumes that the precursors were not Unathi, but many have started coming to the false idea that they were.
