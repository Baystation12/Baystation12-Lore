# Unathi Biology

Unathi are a race of tall, reptilian humanoids that possess both crocodile-like and serpent-like features. Their scales are hard and plate- 
like, save for the softer ones that line the inside of their legs, armpits, and groin.

Males stand six to seven feet tall, while females are about a half of a foot shorter on average. Females also tend to possess rounder 
snouts than their male counterparts. Both stand on plantigrade legs with clawed feet that make wearing standard shoes painful.

The life expectancy of a Moghes Unathi who has decent living conditions is about 70 years. Those with more advanced medical care outside of 
Moghes often live longer.

As a cold-blooded species, they suffer fatigue and even short comas when exposed to extremely low temperatures. Their hearts have two 
valves that are spread across their chest, which makes it sound as if they have two heartbeats at once. Unlike humans, their ribs are in 
armor-like plates that interlock under their chest, protecting their vital organs expertly.

They also have very long tongues, which may stretch up to a foot and a half long, forked just like a serpent's. In much the same manner as 
snakes, Unathi can sample the air around them using their tongue. Unathi tongues are usually black, extremely long, and very resilient to 
physical harm.

Since they are carnivorous species, their diet mostly consists of meat, though they do have a tolerance to plants and fruits. However, they 
do not get any nutrition from plants, so they are mostly used as garnish or decoration. Because they lack a second palate, Unathi cannot 
breathe while they are eating.

The reproductive system of a Unathi is very similar to that of Earth reptiles. Females lay eggs, with the average clutch being somewhere 
between one and three. They have a six month gestation period, after which they are laid in a humid, warm area. After two to three weeks, 
the fetus is fully developed and hatches from the egg, ready to start the cycle anew.

## Disease

*Black egg* Syndrome is a genetic defect found in some females in semi-rare cases, and even rarer in males (Though it manifests in it's own 
form of extreme impotency.). It is a case where laid eggs are both always coming in singles, and the egg itself has a black shell, is 3 
times as thick as normal egg shells, and has a tarpy texture instead of a brittle one, in some cultures this may get the female branded and 
exiled as unfit for breeding, or declared unfit for breeding or other female duties and treated/casted like a male and trusted with their 
responsibilities, while the eggs are left to die. In others that do understand this condition, it is treatable by two methods, to either 
pry open the egg shell with sharp implements and effort. (Call Unathi Kreiger and give him a saw and crowbar) or genetic therapy, though 
the exact line of code that causes this hasn't been found.
