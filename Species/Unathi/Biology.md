# Unathi Biology

Unathi are a race of tall, reptilian humanoids that possess both crocodile-like and serpent-like features. Their scales are hard and plate-like, save for the softer ones that line the inside of their legs, armpits, and groin.

Males stand six to seven feet tall, while females are about a half of a foot shorter on average. Females also tend to possess rounder 
snouts than their male counterparts. Both stand on plantigrade legs with clawed feet that make wearing standard shoes painful.

The oldest Unathi live to be in their late 250s, but most don't make it that far, often dropping off into the 100s or far earlier.

As a cold-blooded species, they suffer fatigue and even short comas when exposed to extremely low temperatures. Their hearts have two 
valves that are spread across their chest, which makes it sound as if they have two heartbeats at once. Unlike humans, their ribs are in 
armor-like plates that interlock under their chest, protecting their vital organs expertly.

They also have very long tongues, which may stretch up to a foot and a half long, forked just like a serpent's. In much the same manner as 
snakes, Unathi can sample the air around them using their tongue. Unathi tongues are usually black, extremely long, and very resilient to 
physical harm.

Since they are carnivorous species, their diet mostly consists of meat, though they do have a tolerance to plants and fruits. However, they 
do not get any nutrition from plants, so they are mostly used as garnish or decoration. Because they lack a second palate, Unathi cannot 
breathe while they are eating.

The reproductive system of a Unathi is very similar to that of Earth reptiles. Females lay eggs, with the average clutch being somewhere 
between one and three. They have a six month gestation period, after which they are laid in a humid, warm area. After two to three weeks, 
the fetus is fully developed and hatches from the egg, ready to start the cycle anew.

## Behaviour

Irritation or heightened emotion is expressed by thumping the tail against the ground. Verbal exclamations are also common, as are short barks, rattling of the throat, or 'chuffing' (forceful exhalations of air from low in the throat). Anxious or worried Unathi might sway (similar to snakes), rattle the heavy scaling on their neck, hiss, or sample air more often than necessary. When cold, a Unathi will usually bristle their scales in a manner analogous to human goosebumps. Overheated Unathi become sluggish and drowsy.

It is a social faux-pass to use a Unathi's first name, to touch their tail, or to touch them at all before introductions are undertaken. When speaking to superiors, it is considered formal and respectful to refer to them by the extended name of their command. A clan leader would be referred to by the name of their clan, a squad leader by the name of their squad.

Intimate gestures between Unathi include twining necks, twining tails, and touching foreheads/muzzles. Hugging is usually considered something done by children, avoided by adults. In moments of privacy, when speaking to a very intimate other, a Unathi might refer to them by their own name.

Baring the throat is the single most meaningful expression of trust in a lover or superior, often used as shows of extreme trust, compassion or admittance of shame, and within honourable contexts, clawing or biting the exposed throat is perfectly allowed.

Female Unathi are treated as valuable property by males.


## Disease

*Black egg* Syndrome is a genetic defect found in some females in semi-rare cases, and even rarer in males (Though it manifests in it's own 
form of extreme impotency.). It is a case where laid eggs are both always coming in singles, and the egg itself has a black shell, is 3 
times as thick as normal egg shells, and has a tarpy texture instead of a brittle one, in some cultures this may get the female branded and 
exiled as unfit for breeding, or declared unfit for breeding or other female duties and treated/casted like a male and trusted with their 
responsibilities, while the eggs are left to die. In others that do understand this condition, it is treatable by two methods, to either 
pry open the egg shell with sharp implements and effort. (Call Unathi Kreiger and give him a saw and crowbar) or genetic therapy, though 
the exact line of code that causes this hasn't been found.
