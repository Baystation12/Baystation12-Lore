# Unathi City States

Vast cities filled with a variety of different clans dot across the landscape, 15 of these esteemed capitals exist. The largest of them 
is Mumbak, currently controlled by the Skalwa Clan, has as dozens if not hundreds different Clans living in it, or near its borders. The 
city itself is a sprawling thing, covering a great swathe of land. Old style factories sit in the city, filling the air with smog, 
shipyards and docks fillwed with rusted old things and brand new merchant vessels from offworld lay in the city. Favelas filled with the 
homes of millions of unathi sit next to the great markets where offworlders trade with Unathi merchants, and travellers can rest and 
recover. This is common for each of the polar city states, as they offer relatively the same services but with different clans and even 
things for sale. The city states of the interior of the planet, such as the great Boating City Wasgaelli, the Diamond Peak Fortress of 
Durzakrag, the Bunker Town of Lo, or the Thriving Moving Cities of the Savannahs atop their great Ogashes.

Durzakrag, Sen uuma, and Saris Nirz are the City States of the Diamond Peaks, the largest settlements of the region. Often resembling 
great castles due to their sturdy, defensive walls.

Lo, Morr, and Pak are Precursor Bunkers which are now home to Desert Clan City States. The vast, empty bunkers are now filled with 
homes, shops, and escape from the harsh surface above.

Wasgaelli and Gaza'lor are both Flaoting Cities of the Swamps. Everything in them is built on great boats or platforms or rafts, 
anything, and rarely land. They could be compared to rinky-dink versions of Venice, but much more defended. 

Koja is the sole standing City State of the Savannahs, built out of one of the Great Trees, Koja is surrounded in farms and ranches 
whose meat and agriculture are brought to the Poles to sell to offworlders. 

Barra Gei and Lemo are nomadic settlements, the largest of their kind, each with nearly 100 Ogashes of their own. They travel throughout the Svannahs, Poles and Deserts, living from place to place and rarely being in the same place twice.
