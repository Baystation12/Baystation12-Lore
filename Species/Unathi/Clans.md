# Unathi Clans

## **Gresis Clan:**
The Gresis Clan, one of the most powerful in the Diamond Peaks area, is one very centralized around religion. Members 
of this clan are clearly identified, as they wear symbols of pickaxes being illuminated on their clothes, showing their pride in their 
work. Starting at the age of around eight, every member works in mining. They do this as they believe the work helps to properly educate 
their young to truly appreciate the luxuries in life. On top of this, they are followers of the Fruitful Lights religion, believing that 
every diamond they dig up brings them closer to the Precursors. The area they are in is known to be very richly saturated with diamonds, 
and they have “lovingly” taken to calling this area, Saris Nirz, considering the land a gift from the Precursors themselves. Because of 
this, they have been fighting for dominance in the area since they got there centuries ago. They have made vassals of various clans, 
those who wanted to destroy them, and those that wanted to expand their faith through working. Ver’sik Gresis, the current, and sole 
leader of the Gresis Clan, has been continuing the traditions that his clan have set. However, as more and more off-worlders come to the 
Diamond Peaks, mining close to Saris Nirz, the more volatile their relations become. They see the off-worlder mining operations as 
interferences with the purpose that the Precursors created them for, and because of this, have lead many attacks to drive them out of 
the area. While not completely stopping it, they have more or less driven off-worlders out of the area they inhabit. They seek to 
fulfill the purpose they believe they were sent there for, and do not intend to let others stop them in their path.

## **Ulig'vas and Jez'vik Clan:**
The Ulig’vas, and Jez’vik clans are individually small, and have always been like that. They are both 
also practicers of Grand Stratagem. The Ulig’vas are hunters, seeing each prey they kill as a means to better themselves, and learn more 
about life. The Jez’vik however, are more militant fighters, trying to keep their supplies secure as they transport goods throughout the 
deserts. Both of their nomadic ways though the deserts have proven that a small reliable group, was better than a larger one. However, 
both of their relative smallness lead to both of their downfalls, as another clan, Clan Sorize, one vastly bigger than them, vassalized 
them, and effectively made them their slaves. This went on for decades, and the Sorize’s takings from these clans eventually pushed them 
over the edge. Ar’resk Ulig’vas and Korem Jez’vik, leaders of their respective clans, joined their clans together to take out their 
tyrannical leaders. Being successful in their endeavours, and realizing they shared not only a similar background, but religion, the two 
clans became quick friends. The Ulig’vas helped to Jez’vik keep protected from the fauna, and the Jez’vik help the Ulig’vas trade their 
goods, and become profitable. Maintaining their own individual beliefs, they travel together, and hunt together, sharing their beliefs 
and traditions with one another as if they were the same clan. They continue their nomadic practices, and they hunt down the Duneworms, 
and other fauna native to the deserts that make up Moghes, together, fighting them with made spears, and swords. Because of their new 
size, and ability to cover larger ground more successfully now, they have been able to make a profit from their hunting. They commonly 
travel into the Savannahs to trade the excess food for water, and other supplies, and pick up good to transport to other areas. As they 
travel together, in much happier times, they are ever vigilant to not let the mistakes of the past repeat.

## **Issarik Clan:**
The Issarik Clan, has always taught that curiosity, and discovery, was key to survival. With every new advancement, 
their odds of surviving increased, and without the curiosity to drive discovery, you would die. Such teachings are still ingrained in 
their beliefs, and their current leader, Koszes Issarik, has kept it that way. The Issarik Clan currently resides in the Northern Pole 
of Moghes, and has been now for decades after the discoveries of Precursor technology. They are devout worshipers of the Precursor 
technology, and have been trying to integrate, and recreate the technological artifacts that they acquire. While most other clans in the 
area would argue with them, they see this as the only way to truly honor the ones that came before them, and advance their own race to 
the future. They fight those who would seek to hinder their progress, and have established more than a name for themselves because of 
it.Their engineering skill is known throughout the Northern Pole, and they are usually sought after to repair, and acquire hardsuits, 
and more advanced weaponry, such as energy swords, or laser rifles. Progress is a means to make their clan, and their race, great, and 
they seek to get to the point where they can join the stars with the rest of the Galaxy.

## **Zes'lin Clan:**
The Zesli’n Clan, are a tribe of boaters in the Derzin Swamps. They were a clan that had lived in the Savanahs, 
devout followers of the Hand of the Vine movement, but clan leader Issek decided that in pursuit to spread plant life throughout Moghes, 
they must cleanse the toxicity of the swamps to make it more habitable. Though this goal has not been accomplished fully, Derzin Swamps 
has over a long period of time, gradually recovered and become more habitable. Even to this day, the clan is firm that their efforts to 
cleanse the swamps will reward them greatly. Many Hand of the Vine members stop by the Swamps for periods of rest, and recovery from the 
deserts, and the Zesli’n Clan are more than happy to have them. The current clan leader, Seva, has been trying to lead them further into 
the swamps, where they before did not dare, to clean a larger area faster. In addition to this, Seva has also been treating the women of 
his clan more like the males, sending them out to do tasks that the men used to do, before they spent most of their days cleaning. The 
cleansing will not only help the planet, but it will bring us closer to our faith, and serve a great purpose.

## **Tessereck Clan:**
The Tessereck Clan, is an very odd clan, living in the deserts of the equator, in a long lost military bomb 
shelter, capable of housing nearly three hundred individuals. How they originally came to be, was twenty exiles, male and female, from 
three different clans, Tesak, Ser’vize, and Recksesua, banding together to survive. They created the name above, as to preserve the 
memory of those that discarded them. The discovery of this shelter save them from the radiated wastes outside, but it provided them with 
precursor weapons, and gear to help them survive. Due to their tough circumstances, they have mostly abandoned most traditions, with 
women being treated as almost equals, although they still have to take care of the cooking/cleaning, and despite being practicers of 
Grand Stratagem, preferring firearms when dealing with others. Any exile who braves the storms, will be welcomed with open arms, and 
treated as a member of the clan, as if they were born there. Despite being made of exiles, and wanting places to stay, they have very 
strict rules, that can get someone exiled yet again, and that exile is much harsher, most not able to leave the equator. Also in honor 
of the three different clans the original twenty came from, they have three leaders that act like a council for their group. Members of 
the council are the strongest three Unathi of the clan. The current three leaders, Yexasz, Gi’elz, and Taskhar, are leading the 
Tessereck clan to new grounds. Before, they were mostly keeping their existence more or less a myth, a secret hope for exiles on Moghes, 
but now, they are expanding their horizons. Their huge population, amassing an outstanding one hundred eighty seven members, makes it 
easy to spread out, and do the jobs required, and with their new gear, and their overall versatility, they are moving on to do jobs for 
clans in need of assistance, and willing to pay. Though discarded, they will show this world the mark that they may leave upon it.

## **I'lesk Clan:**
The I’lesk Clan, is one that has used its fortunate past for others. Desa, a clan leader from centuries ago, found 
Precursor texts of medical procedures. By studying these texts, the clan became a valued asset for the Southern Pole of Moghes, as some 
of the best doctors around. Their knowledge of the medical field thanks to these texts has allowed them to gain a significant amount of 
influence, and power, with many clans not so much as touching them for fear of being denied service in the future. However, this does 
not come without its caveats, with many clans trying to steal their texts to gain the knowledge for themselves. While no successful 
attempts have been made, it has caused a serious problem, and caused many conflicts with other clans. Their small size only worsens the 
matter, but thankfully, a good amount of clans have protected them in the past. Anyone who shares, or tries to share the knowledge 
outside the clan, is promptly branded, and exiled off-world, in an attempt to keep their status. The current clan leader, Tavex, has 
already had to exile his eldest son for this reason. He leads the clan with an iron fist, to keep everyone in line, and the knowledge 
from the texts hidden. Knowledge is power, and none know this better than the I’lesk clan.

## **Insthyr Clan:**
A smaller clan that borders between the most northern parts of the Diamond Peaks and the Poles, the Insthyrs are 
often a part of conflict due to their location. Their capital is one of the larger ports in the North Pole, and is often common to the 
trade of weapons, food, and water for the region. Not only that, but with their close vicinity to the Diamond Peaks, raiders from the 
region often come to the Insthyr in hopes to take their profit. Hard workers, sturdy fighters, and stiff traders, the Insthyrs are 
commonly known to be staunch followers of the Fruitful Lights, and their leader Gogriss uses the faith as law for his people, if you can 
even call it faith. They often let clanmembers travel off world in looks for more craft that they can bring back to Moghes. 

## **Nels'thar Clan:**
The Nels'thar clan are the dominant power in the southern pole city of S'igek Nels'thar. They poses a
n ancient mass driver which they have made functional and used to great effect, now having contact with NanoTrasen and several other 
human organizations, and having gone as far as to make a bid for the Interstellar Assembly. Aliger Nels'thar is the current ruler of the 
Nels'thar Clan, he is driving his people to gather technology, either that of the precursors or from off world sources. The clan 
believes in the importance of preserving every bit of precursor technology they can find. The older members of the clan are inclined 
towards believing the precursors to be an almost demigod race, the great benefactors that make the clan’s fortunes possible. The younger 
members of the clan are not so sure, they still treat precursor ruins with utmost respect, but do not believe in the precursors as being 
all important like their forefathers. Despite their attempts at gathering knew technology they are wary of displaying it to their 
neighbors. Recent tensions in the area has caused them to make a show of their belief in tradition, even if they no longer fully agree 
with it
