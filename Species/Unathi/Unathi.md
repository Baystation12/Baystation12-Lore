# The Unathi

The Unathi (Ew-nath-ee) are a race of tall, reptilian humanoids that possess both crocodile-like and serpent-like features. Their scales are hard and plate-like, save for the softer ones that line the inside of their legs, armpits, and groin. Originating from the planet of [Moghes](https://baystation12.net/lore/Planets-and-Systems/XenoHomeworlds/Moghes), the Unathi live in an extremely sexist society, with women being considered property.

## An Overview

**Biology**

Unathi are a race of tall, reptilian humanoids that possess both crocodile-like and serpent-like features. Their scales are hard and plate-like, save for the softer ones that line the inside of their legs, armpits, and groin.

Males stand six to seven feet tall, while females are about a half of a foot shorter on average. Females also tend to possess rounder snouts than their male counterparts. Both stand on plantigrade legs with clawed feet that make wearing standard shoes painful.

The life expectancy of a Moghes Unathi who has decent living conditions is about 70 years. Those with more advanced medical care outside of Moghes often live longer.

As a cold-blooded species, they suffer fatigue and even short comas when exposed to extremely low temperatures. Their hearts have two valves that are spread across their chest, which makes it sound as if they have two heartbeats at once. Unlike humans, their ribs are in armor-like plates that interlock under their chest, protecting their vital organs expertly.

They also have very long tongues, which may stretch up to a foot and a half long, forked just like a serpent's. In much the same manner as snakes, Unathi can sample the air around them using their tongue. Unathi tongues are usually black, extremely long, and very resilient to physical harm.

Since they are carnivorous species, their diet mostly consists of meat, though they do have a tolerance to plants and fruits. However, they do not get any nutrition from plants, so they are mostly used as garnish or decoration. Because they lack a second palate, Unathi cannot breathe while they are eating.

The reproductive system of a Unathi is very similar to that of Earth reptiles. Females lay eggs, with the average clutch being somewhere between one and three. They have a six month gestation period, after which they are laid in a humid, warm area. After two to three weeks, the fetus is fully developed and hatches from the egg, ready to start the cycle anew.

**Behaviour**

Irritation or heightened emotion is expressed by thumping the tail against the ground. Verbal exclamations are also common, as are short barks, rattling of the throat, or 'chuffing' (forceful exhalations of air from low in the throat). Anxious or worried Unathi might sway (similar to snakes), rattle the heavy scaling on their neck, hiss, or sample air more often than necessary. When cold, a Unathi will usually bristle their scales in a manner analogous to human goosebumps. Overheated Unathi become sluggish and drowsy.

It is a social faux-pass to use a Unathi's first name, to touch their tail, or to touch them at all before introductions are undertaken. When speaking to superiors, it is considered formal and respectful to refer to them by the extended name of their command. A clan leader would be referred to by the name of their clan, a squad leader by the name of their squad.

Intimate gestures between Unathi include twining necks, twining tails, and touching foreheads/muzzles. Hugging is usually considered something done by children, avoided by adults. In moments of privacy, when speaking to a very intimate other, a Unathi might refer to them by their own name.

Baring the throat is the single most meaningful expression of trust in a lover or superior, often used as shows of extreme trust, compassion or admittance of shame, and within honourable contexts, clawing or biting the exposed throat is perfectly allowed.

Female Unathi are treated as valuable property by males. For more information see [Unathi Culture](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Culture)

## The People of Moghes

Unathi are a species deeply rooted in family and tradition. Settlements are made up of many clans with an average being somewhere around five and seven at a time to thriving capitols that protect (for a tribute) the other settlements around it. They are part of a large trade network and even have space ports for foreign ships to dock at and unload their goods.


*Imagine sitting on the top of your hut in your small clan village, just under the shade of one of the Savannah's great trees. THe light of Sunset glistens a great purple hue across the sky as it shimmers against the Diamond Peaks across the horizon. You can see smoke rising from the Mountain Ranges, as Day Peaced Times rages on. A herd of Sissaliks bustle near by, led on by several farmers in traditional robes. A nomad clan in the distance, their great Ogashes moving steadily along with several Sissaliks and other animals alongside many more Unathi.*

*A plate of Bor, dried meats with herb rub and a chilled sauce made from the thick, sweet leaves of a local plant sits next to you.*

*You can hear the matriarch singing in her raspy voice from just up the way, as there aren't any doors on most of the huts. Today she adds to our Skein, as one of your wive's eggs broke, bringing a new son, your seventh. In the sky above, several ships leaving port in the great City of Mumbak dash through the air, and just in sight for the naked eye, a great space station floating with the stars. A basic cyborg unit is near you, tending to a female gnar who just gave birth to a new litter. The watering season is beginning soon, so you will have work enough ahead for these new ones. Across the horizon you can see a Metal Forest, great hulking masses of twisted, red metal from an age long forgotten. Remnants of the Precursors.*


### [A Short History](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/History)

Long ago, there lived a race of aliens with great, technological power. Now they are no more and their ruins dot the brutal, dying world that the Unathi now call home. 

### [The Unathi Way of Life](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Culture)

The ultraconservative, highly traditionalist Unathi live by a simple mindset; If it isn't broke, don't try and fix it.

### [Technology](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Technology)

Mad Max meets Halo in surprising ways for Unathi Technology

### [Military](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Military)

Powerful and Brutal, Unathi Warriors are some of the most dangerous in Known Space, but they're definitely not the type to stab you in the back.

### [Religion](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Religion)

The religions of Moghes are as equally diverse as it's natives. Much like perceptions of honor, the following of each faith is entirely regional, and none hold many more followers than the other.

### [Major Clans](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Clans)

With the strange structure of Unathi society comes to the political, cultural, and uniting interest between the various Unathi: Clans. The Clans of Moghes are the leaders of the planets various city-states, and the main focus of politics on the planet. They shape everything, from the infighting between two different Unathi, to the different cultures and societies of the planet. Unathi that are a part of a clan take that Clan name for their last name, and that is often what they are addressed when they are not on Moghes itself. It is also very common for two Unathi of opposed clans to breakout into violence even when they're off-world. This is a list of various clans from the planet, and where they are from.


### City States

There are plenty of villages, settlements and other such things across the planet of Moghes, but the real capitals are the City-States. Vast cities filled with a variety of different clans dot across the landscape, 15 of these esteemed capitals exist. The largest of them is Mumbak, currently controlled by the Issek Clan, has as many as 30 different Clans living in it, or near its borders. The city itself is a sprawling thing, covering a great swathe of land. Old style factories sit in the city, filling the air with smog, shipyards and docks fillwed with rusted old things and brand new merchant vessels from offworld lay in the city. Favelas filled with the homes of millions of unathi sit next to the great markets where offworlders trade with Unathi merchants, and travellers can rest and recover. This is common for each of the polar city states, as they offer relatively the same services but with different clans and even things for sale. The city states of the interior of the planet, such as the great Boating City Wasgaelli, the Diamond Peak Fortress of Durzakrag, the Bunker Town of Lo, or the Thriving Moving Cities of the Savannahs atop their great Ogashes.
The 15 primary City States are as Follow:

* [Mumbak](https://baystation12.net/lore/Planets And Systems/UCS/Mumbak.md)
* [Si'gek Nel'sthar](https://baystation12.net/lore/Planets And Systems/UCS/S'igek Nels'thar.md)
* Instha
^ No'lesk City
* Durzakrag Fortress
* Bunker Town of Lo
* Morr Bunker Town
* Pak Bunker
* The Moving City of Barra Gei
* The Moving City of Lemo
* Saris Nirz Fortress
* Wasgaelli
* Gaza'lor
* Sen Uuma Fortress
* Koja

Mumbak, Si'gek Nels'thar, Instha, and No'lesk City all exist in the Poles, each great trading ports for offworlders (though none as big as Mumbak in terms of Interregional, Moghesian Trade).

Durzakrag, Sen uuma, and Saris Nirz are the City States of the Diamond Peaks, the largest settlements of the region. Often resembling great castles due to their sturdy, defensive walls.

Lo, Morr, and Pak are Precursor Bunkers which are now home to Desert Clan City States. The vast, empty bunkers are now filled with homes, shops, and escape from the harsh surface above.

Wasgaelli and Gaza'lor are both Flaoting Cities of the Swamps. Everything in them is built on great boats or platforms or rafts, anything, and rarely land. They could be compared to rinky-dink versions of Venice, but much more defended. 

Koja is the sole standing City State of the Savannahs, built out of one of the Great Trees, Koja is surrounded in farms and ranches whose meat and agriculture are brought to the Poles to sell to offworlders. 

Barra Gei and Lemo are nomadic settlements, the largest of their kind, each with nearly 100 Ogashes of their own. They travel throughout the Svannahs, Poles and Deserts, living from place to place and rarely being in the same place twice. 

### Disease

*Black egg* Syndrome is a genetic defect found in some females in semi-rare cases, and even rarer in males (Though it manifests in it's own form of extreme impotency.). It is a case where laid eggs are both always coming in singles, and the egg itself has a black shell, is 3 times as thick as normal egg shells, and has a tarpy texture instead of a brittle one, in some cultures this may get the female branded and exiled as unfit for breeding, or declared unfit for breeding or other female duties and treated/casted like a male and trusted with their responsibilities, while the eggs are left to die. In others that do understand this condition, it is treatable by two methods, to either pry open the egg shell with sharp implements and effort. (Call Unathi Kreiger and give him a saw and crowbar) or genetic therapy, though the exact line of code that causes this hasn't been found.

## Relations
Sol Gov: Open for diplomacy and trade, often at odds due to trouble with TSCs
TSCs: Open for trade, but mostly disliked by the various clans on the planets.
Skrell: Open for diplomacy and trade, and often on agreeable terms.
Tajara: Mostly no contact besides for Interstellar matters.
Sirisai: No contact
IPC Union: No direct contact
Vox: At War, in a way. Often in conflict against them on human or skrell vessels. The few Unathi vessels aren't attacked usually as they almost never leave the home system.
