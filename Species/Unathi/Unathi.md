# The Unathi

The Unathi (Ew-nath-ee) are a race of tall, reptilian humanoids that possess both crocodile-like and serpent-like features. Their scales are hard and plate-like, save for the softer ones that line the inside of their legs, armpits, and groin. Originating from the planet of [Moghes](https://baystation12.net/lore/Planets-and-Systems/XenoHomeworlds/Moghes), the Unathi live in an extremely sexist society, with women being considered property.

## The Eyes of a Unathi at Home

*Imagine sitting on the top of your hut in your small clan village, just under the shade of one of the Savannah's great trees. THe light of Sunset glistens a great purple hue across the sky as it shimmers against the Diamond Peaks across the horizon. You can see smoke rising from the Mountain Ranges, as Day Peaced Times rages on. A herd of Sissaliks bustle near by, led on by several farmers in traditional robes. A nomad clan in the distance, their great Ogashes moving steadily along with several Sissaliks and other animals alongside many more Unathi.*

*A plate of Bor, dried meats with herb rub and a chilled sauce made from the thick, sweet leaves of a local plant sits next to you.*

*You can hear the matriarch singing in her raspy voice from just up the way, as there aren't any doors on most of the huts. Today she adds to our Skein, as one of your wive's eggs broke, bringing a new son, your seventh. In the sky above, several ships leaving port in the great City of Mumbak dash through the air, and just in sight for the naked eye, a great space station floating with the stars. A basic cyborg unit is near you, tending to a female gnar who just gave birth to a new litter. The watering season is beginning soon, so you will have work enough ahead for these new ones. Across the horizon you can see a Metal Forest, great hulking masses of twisted, red metal from an age long forgotten. Remnants of the Precursors.*

### [A Short History](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/History)

Long ago, there lived a race of aliens with great, technological power. Now they are no more and their ruins dot the brutal, dying world that the Unathi now call home. 

### [Their Biology](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Biology)

The basics of the inner health and systems of the Unathi, and how they are able to survive their brutal homeworld.

### [The Unathi Way of Life](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Culture)

Unathi are a species deeply rooted in family and tradition. Settlements are made up of many clans with an average being somewhere around five and seven at a time to thriving capitols that protect (for a tribute) the other settlements around it. They are part of a large trade network and even have space ports for foreign ships to dock at and unload their goods.

### [Technology](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Technology)

Mad Max meets Halo in surprising ways for Unathi Technology

### [Military](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Military)

Powerful and Brutal, Unathi Warriors are some of the most dangerous in Known Space, but they're definitely not the type to stab you in the back.

### [Religion](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Religion)

The religions of Moghes are as equally diverse as it's natives. Much like perceptions of honor, the following of each faith is entirely regional, and none hold many more followers than the other.

### [Major Clans](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Clans)

With the strange structure of Unathi society comes to the political, cultural, and uniting interest between the various Unathi: Clans. The Clans of Moghes are the leaders of the planets various city-states, and the main focus of politics on the planet. They shape everything, from the infighting between two different Unathi, to the different cultures and societies of the planet. Unathi that are a part of a clan take that Clan name for their last name, and that is often what they are addressed when they are not on Moghes itself. It is also very common for two Unathi of opposed clans to breakout into violence even when they're off-world. This is a list of various clans from the planet, and where they are from.

### [City States](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Cities)

There are plenty of villages, settlements and other such things across the planet of Moghes, but the real capitals are the City-States.

## Relations
* Sol Gov: Open for diplomacy and trade, often at odds due to trouble with TSCs
* TSCs: Open for trade, but mostly disliked by the various clans on the planets.
* Skrell: Open for diplomacy and trade, and often on agreeable terms.
* Tajara: Mostly no contact besides for Interstellar matters.
* Sirisai: No contact
* IPC Union: No direct contact
* Vox: At War, in a way. Often in conflict against them on human or skrell vessels. The few Unathi vessels aren't attacked usually as 
they almost never leave the home system.
