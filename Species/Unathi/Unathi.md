# The Unathi

The Unathi (Ew-nath-ee) are a race of tall, reptilian humanoids that possess both crocodile-like and serpent-like features. Their scales are hard and plate-like, save for the softer ones that line the inside of their legs, armpits, and groin. Originating from the planet of [Moghes](https://baystation12.net/lore/Planets-and-Systems/XenoHomeworlds/Moghes), the Unathi live in an extremely sexist society, with women being considered property.

## An Overview

**Biology**

Unathi are a race of tall, reptilian humanoids that possess both crocodile-like and serpent-like features. Their scales are hard and plate-like, save for the softer ones that line the inside of their legs, armpits, and groin.

Males stand six to seven feet tall, while females are about a half of a foot shorter on average. Females also tend to possess rounder snouts than their male counterparts. Both stand on plantigrade legs with clawed feet that make wearing standard shoes painful.

The life expectancy of a Moghes Unathi who has decent living conditions is about 70 years. Those with more advanced medical care outside of Moghes often live longer.

As a cold-blooded species, they suffer fatigue and even short comas when exposed to extremely low temperatures. Their hearts have two valves that are spread across their chest, which makes it sound as if they have two heartbeats at once. Unlike humans, their ribs are in armor-like plates that interlock under their chest, protecting their vital organs expertly.

They also have very long tongues, which may stretch up to a foot and a half long, forked just like a serpent's. In much the same manner as snakes, Unathi can sample the air around them using their tongue. Unathi tongues are usually black, extremely long, and very resilient to physical harm.

Since they are carnivorous species, their diet mostly consists of meat, though they do have a tolerance to plants and fruits. However, they do not get any nutrition from plants, so they are mostly used as garnish or decoration. Because they lack a second palate, Unathi cannot breathe while they are eating.

The reproductive system of a Unathi is very similar to that of Earth reptiles. Females lay eggs, with the average clutch being somewhere between one and three. They have a six month gestation period, after which they are laid in a humid, warm area. After two to three weeks, the fetus is fully developed and hatches from the egg, ready to start the cycle anew.

**Behaviour**

Irritation or heightened emotion is expressed by thumping the tail against the ground. Verbal exclamations are also common, as are short barks, rattling of the throat, or 'chuffing' (forceful exhalations of air from low in the throat). Anxious or worried Unathi might sway (similar to snakes), rattle the heavy scaling on their neck, hiss, or sample air more often than necessary. When cold, a Unathi will usually bristle their scales in a manner analogous to human goosebumps. Overheated Unathi become sluggish and drowsy.

It is a social faux-pass to use a Unathi's first name, to touch their tail, or to touch them at all before introductions are undertaken. When speaking to superiors, it is considered formal and respectful to refer to them by the extended name of their command. A clan leader would be referred to by the name of their clan, a squad leader by the name of their squad.

Intimate gestures between Unathi include twining necks, twining tails, and touching foreheads/muzzles. Hugging is usually considered something done by children, avoided by adults. In moments of privacy, when speaking to a very intimate other, a Unathi might refer to them by their own name.

Baring the throat is the single most meaningful expression of trust in a lover or superior, often used as shows of extreme trust, compassion or admittance of shame, and within honourable contexts, clawing or biting the exposed throat is perfectly allowed.

Female Unathi are treated as valuable property by males. For more information see [Unathi Culture](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Culture)

## The People of Moghes

Unathi are a species deeply rooted in family and tradition. Settlements are made up of many clans with an average being somewhere around five and seven at a time to thriving capitols that protect (for a tribute) the other settlements around it. They are part of a large trade network and even have space ports for foreign ships to dock at and unload their goods.


*Imagine sitting on the top of your hut in your small clan village, just under the shade of one of the Savannah's great trees. THe light of Sunset glistens a great purple hue across the sky as it shimmers against the Diamond Peaks across the horizon. You can see smoke rising from the Mountain Ranges, as Day Peaced Times rages on. A herd of Sissaliks bustle near by, led on by several farmers in traditional robes. A nomad clan in the distance, their great Ogashes moving steadily along with several Sissaliks and other animals alongside many more Unathi.*

*A plate of Bor, dried meats with herb rub and a chilled sauce made from the thick, sweet leaves of a local plant sits next to you.*

*You can hear the matriarch singing in her raspy voice from just up the way, as there aren't any doors on most of the huts. Today she adds to our Skein, as one of your wive's eggs broke, bringing a new son, your seventh. In the sky above, several ships leaving port in the great City of Mumbak dash through the air, and just in sight for the naked eye, a great space station floating with the stars. A basic cyborg unit is near you, tending to a female gnar who just gave birth to a new litter. The watering season is beginning soon, so you will have work enough ahead for these new ones. Across the horizon you can see a Metal Forest, great hulking masses of twisted, red metal from an age long forgotten. Remnants of the Precursors.*


### [A Short History](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/History)

Long ago, there lived a race of aliens with great, technological power. Now they are no more and their ruins dot the brutal, dying world that the Unathi now call home. 

### [The Unathi Way of Life](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Culture)

The ultraconservative, highly traditionalist Unathi live by a simple mindset; If it isn't broke, don't try and fix it.

### [Technology](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Technology)

Mad Max meets Halo in surprising ways for Unathi Technology

### [Military](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Military)

Powerful and Brutal, Unathi Warriors are some of the most dangerous in Known Space, but they're definitely not the type to stab you in the back.

### [Religion](https://baystation12.net/lore/Species/Unathi/Religion)

The religions of Moghes are as equally diverse as it's natives. Much like perceptions of honor, the following of each faith is entirely regional, and none hold many more followers than the other.

### Major Clans

With the strange structure of Unathi society comes to the political, cultural, and uniting interest between the various Unathi: Clans. The Clans of Moghes are the leaders of the planets various city-states, and the main focus of politics on the planet. They shape everything, from the infighting between two different Unathi, to the different cultures and societies of the planet. Unathi that are a part of a clan take that Clan name for their last name, and that is often what they are addressed when they are not on Moghes itself. It is also very common for two Unathi of opposed clans to breakout into violence even when they're off-world. This is a list of various clans from the planet, and where they are from.

* **Gresis Clan:** The Gresis Clan, one of the most powerful in the Diamond Peaks area, is one very centralized around religion. Members of this clan are clearly identified, as they wear symbols of pickaxes being illuminated on their clothes, showing their pride in their work. Starting at the age of around eight, every member works in mining. They do this as they believe the work helps to properly educate their young to truly appreciate the luxuries in life. On top of this, they are followers of the Fruitful Lights religion, believing that every diamond they dig up brings them closer to the Precursors. The area they are in is known to be very richly saturated with diamonds, and they have “lovingly” taken to calling this area, Saris Nirz, considering the land a gift from the Precursors themselves. Because of this, they have been fighting for dominance in the area since they got there centuries ago. They have made vassals of various clans, those who wanted to destroy them, and those that wanted to expand their faith through working. Ver’sik Gresis, the current, and sole leader of the Gresis Clan, has been continuing the traditions that his clan have set. However, as more and more off-worlders come to the Diamond Peaks, mining close to Saris Nirz, the more volatile their relations become. They see the off-worlder mining operations as interferences with the purpose that the Precursors created them for, and because of this, have lead many attacks to drive them out of the area. While not completely stopping it, they have more or less driven off-worlders out of the area they inhabit. They seek to fulfill the purpose they believe they were sent there for, and do not intend to let others stop them in their path.
* **Ulig'vas and Jez'vik Clan:** The Ulig’vas, and Jez’vik clans are individually small, and have always been like that. They are both also practicers of Grand Stratagem. The Ulig’vas are hunters, seeing each prey they kill as a means to better themselves, and learn more about life. The Jez’vik however, are more militant fighters, trying to keep their supplies secure as they transport goods throughout the deserts. Both of their nomadic ways though the deserts have proven that a small reliable group, was better than a larger one. However, both of their relative smallness lead to both of their downfalls, as another clan, Clan Sorize, one vastly bigger than them, vassalized them, and effectively made them their slaves. This went on for decades, and the Sorize’s takings from these clans eventually pushed them over the edge. Ar’resk Ulig’vas and Korem Jez’vik, leaders of their respective clans, joined their clans together to take out their tyrannical leaders. Being successful in their endeavours, and realizing they shared not only a similar background, but religion, the two clans became quick friends. The Ulig’vas helped to Jez’vik keep protected from the fauna, and the Jez’vik help the Ulig’vas trade their goods, and become profitable. Maintaining their own individual beliefs, they travel together, and hunt together, sharing their beliefs and traditions with one another as if they were the same clan. They continue their nomadic practices, and they hunt down the Duneworms, and other fauna native to the deserts that make up Moghes, together, fighting them with made spears, and swords. Because of their new size, and ability to cover larger ground more successfully now, they have been able to make a profit from their hunting. They commonly travel into the Savannahs to trade the excess food for water, and other supplies, and pick up good to transport to other areas. As they travel together, in much happier times, they are ever vigilant to not let the mistakes of the past repeat.
* **Issarik Clan:** The Issarik Clan, has always taught that curiosity, and discovery, was key to survival. With every new advancement, their odds of surviving increased, and without the curiosity to drive discovery, you would die. Such teachings are still ingrained in their beliefs, and their current leader, Koszes Issarik, has kept it that way. The Issarik Clan currently resides in the Northern Pole of Moghes, and has been now for decades after the discoveries of Precursor technology. They are devout worshipers of the Precursor technology, and have been trying to integrate, and recreate the technological artifacts that they acquire. While most other clans in the area would argue with them, they see this as the only way to truly honor the ones that came before them, and advance their own race to the future. They fight those who would seek to hinder their progress, and have established more than a name for themselves because of it.Their engineering skill is known throughout the Northern Pole, and they are usually sought after to repair, and acquire hardsuits, and more advanced weaponry, such as energy swords, or laser rifles. Progress is a means to make their clan, and their race, great, and they seek to get to the point where they can join the stars with the rest of the Galaxy.
* **Zes'lin Clan:** The Zesli’n Clan, are a tribe of boaters in the Derzin Swamps. They were a clan that had lived in the Savanahs, devout followers of the Hand of the Vine movement, but clan leader Issek decided that in pursuit to spread plant life throughout Moghes, they must cleanse the toxicity of the swamps to make it more habitable. Though this goal has not been accomplished fully, Derzin Swamps has over a long period of time, gradually recovered and become more habitable. Even to this day, the clan is firm that their efforts to cleanse the swamps will reward them greatly. Many Hand of the Vine members stop by the Swamps for periods of rest, and recovery from the deserts, and the Zesli’n Clan are more than happy to have them. The current clan leader, Seva, has been trying to lead them further into the swamps, where they before did not dare, to clean a larger area faster. In addition to this, Seva has also been treating the women of his clan more like the males, sending them out to do tasks that the men used to do, before they spent most of their days cleaning. The cleansing will not only help the planet, but it will bring us closer to our faith, and serve a great purpose.
* **Tessereck Clan:** The Tessereck Clan, is an very odd clan, living in the deserts of the equator, in a long lost military bomb shelter, capable of housing nearly three hundred individuals. How they originally came to be, was twenty exiles, male and female, from three different clans, Tesak, Ser’vize, and Recksesua, banding together to survive. They created the name above, as to preserve the memory of those that discarded them. The discovery of this shelter save them from the radiated wastes outside, but it provided them with precursor weapons, and gear to help them survive. Due to their tough circumstances, they have mostly abandoned most traditions, with women being treated as almost equals, although they still have to take care of the cooking/cleaning, and despite being practicers of Grand Stratagem, preferring firearms when dealing with others. Any exile who braves the storms, will be welcomed with open arms, and treated as a member of the clan, as if they were born there. Despite being made of exiles, and wanting places to stay, they have very strict rules, that can get someone exiled yet again, and that exile is much harsher, most not able to leave the equator. Also in honor of the three different clans the original twenty came from, they have three leaders that act like a council for their group. Members of the council are the strongest three Unathi of the clan. The current three leaders, Yexasz, Gi’elz, and Taskhar, are leading the Tessereck clan to new grounds. Before, they were mostly keeping their existence more or less a myth, a secret hope for exiles on Moghes, but now, they are expanding their horizons. Their huge population, amassing an outstanding one hundred eighty seven members, makes it easy to spread out, and do the jobs required, and with their new gear, and their overall versatility, they are moving on to do jobs for clans in need of assistance, and willing to pay. Though discarded, they will show this world the mark that they may leave upon it.
*  **I'lesk Clan:** The I’lesk Clan, is one that has used its fortunate past for others. Desa, a clan leader from centuries ago, found Precursor texts of medical procedures. By studying these texts, the clan became a valued asset for the Southern Pole of Moghes, as some of the best doctors around. Their knowledge of the medical field thanks to these texts has allowed them to gain a significant amount of influence, and power, with many clans not so much as touching them for fear of being denied service in the future. However, this does not come without its caveats, with many clans trying to steal their texts to gain the knowledge for themselves. While no successful attempts have been made, it has caused a serious problem, and caused many conflicts with other clans. Their small size only worsens the matter, but thankfully, a good amount of clans have protected them in the past. Anyone who shares, or tries to share the knowledge outside the clan, is promptly branded, and exiled off-world, in an attempt to keep their status. The current clan leader, Tavex, has already had to exile his eldest son for this reason. He leads the clan with an iron fist, to keep everyone in line, and the knowledge from the texts hidden. Knowledge is power, and none know this better than the I’lesk clan.
*  **Insthyr Clan:** A smaller clan that borders between the most northern parts of the Diamond Peaks and the Poles, the Insthyrs are often a part of conflict due to their location. Their capital is one of the larger ports in the North Pole, and is often common to the trade of weapons, food, and water for the region. Not only that, but with their close vicinity to the Diamond Peaks, raiders from the region often come to the Insthyr in hopes to take their profit. Hard workers, sturdy fighters, and stiff traders, the Insthyrs are commonly known to be staunch followers of the Fruitful Lights, and their leader Gogriss uses the faith as law for his people, if you can even call it faith. They often let clanmembers travel off world in looks for more craft that they can bring back to Moghes. 
* **Nels'thar Clan:** The Nels'thar clan are the dominant power in the southern pole city of S'igek Nels'thar. They poses an ancient mass driver which they have made functional and used to great effect, now having contact with NanoTrasen and several other human organizations, and having gone as far as to make a bid for the Interstellar Assembly. Aliger Nels'thar is the current ruler of the Nels'thar Clan, he is driving his people to gather technology, either that of the precursors or from off world sources. The clan believes in the importance of preserving every bit of precursor technology they can find. The older members of the clan are inclined towards believing the precursors to be an almost demigod race, the great benefactors that make the clan’s fortunes possible. The younger members of the clan are not so sure, they still treat precursor ruins with utmost respect, but do not believe in the precursors as being all important like their forefathers. Despite their attempts at gathering knew technology they are wary of displaying it to their neighbors. Recent tensions in the area has caused them to make a show of their belief in tradition, even if they no longer fully agree with it

### City States

There are plenty of villages, settlements and other such things across the planet of Moghes, but the real capitals are the City-States. Vast cities filled with a variety of different clans dot across the landscape, 15 of these esteemed capitals exist. The largest of them is Mumbak, currently controlled by the Issek Clan, has as many as 30 different Clans living in it, or near its borders. The city itself is a sprawling thing, covering a great swathe of land. Old style factories sit in the city, filling the air with smog, shipyards and docks fillwed with rusted old things and brand new merchant vessels from offworld lay in the city. Favelas filled with the homes of millions of unathi sit next to the great markets where offworlders trade with Unathi merchants, and travellers can rest and recover. This is common for each of the polar city states, as they offer relatively the same services but with different clans and even things for sale. The city states of the interior of the planet, such as the great Boating City Wasgaelli, the Diamond Peak Fortress of Durzakrag, the Bunker Town of Lo, or the Thriving Moving Cities of the Savannahs atop their great Ogashes.
The 15 primary City States are as Follow:

* [Mumbak](https://baystation12.net/lore/Planets And Systems/UCS/Mumbak.md)
* [Si'gek Nel'sthar](https://baystation12.net/lore/Planets And Systems/UCS/S'igek Nels'thar.md)
* Instha
^ No'lesk City
* Durzakrag Fortress
* Bunker Town of Lo
* Morr Bunker Town
* Pak Bunker
* The Moving City of Barra Gei
* The Moving City of Lemo
* Saris Nirz Fortress
* Wasgaelli
* Gaza'lor
* Sen Uuma Fortress
* Koja

Mumbak, Si'gek Nels'thar, Instha, and No'lesk City all exist in the Poles, each great trading ports for offworlders (though none as big as Mumbak in terms of Interregional, Moghesian Trade).

Durzakrag, Sen uuma, and Saris Nirz are the City States of the Diamond Peaks, the largest settlements of the region. Often resembling great castles due to their sturdy, defensive walls.

Lo, Morr, and Pak are Precursor Bunkers which are now home to Desert Clan City States. The vast, empty bunkers are now filled with homes, shops, and escape from the harsh surface above.

Wasgaelli and Gaza'lor are both Flaoting Cities of the Swamps. Everything in them is built on great boats or platforms or rafts, anything, and rarely land. They could be compared to rinky-dink versions of Venice, but much more defended. 

Koja is the sole standing City State of the Savannahs, built out of one of the Great Trees, Koja is surrounded in farms and ranches whose meat and agriculture are brought to the Poles to sell to offworlders. 

Barra Gei and Lemo are nomadic settlements, the largest of their kind, each with nearly 100 Ogashes of their own. They travel throughout the Svannahs, Poles and Deserts, living from place to place and rarely being in the same place twice. 

### Disease

*Black egg* Syndrome is a genetic defect found in some females in semi-rare cases, and even rarer in males (Though it manifests in it's own form of extreme impotency.). It is a case where laid eggs are both always coming in singles, and the egg itself has a black shell, is 3 times as thick as normal egg shells, and has a tarpy texture instead of a brittle one, in some cultures this may get the female branded and exiled as unfit for breeding, or declared unfit for breeding or other female duties and treated/casted like a male and trusted with their responsibilities, while the eggs are left to die. In others that do understand this condition, it is treatable by two methods, to either pry open the egg shell with sharp implements and effort. (Call Unathi Kreiger and give him a saw and crowbar) or genetic therapy, though the exact line of code that causes this hasn't been found.

## Relations
Sol Gov: Open for diplomacy and trade, often at odds due to trouble with TSCs
TSCs: Open for trade, but mostly disliked by the various clans on the planets.
Skrell: Open for diplomacy and trade, and often on agreeable terms.
Tajara: Mostly no contact besides for Interstellar matters.
Sirisai: No contact
IPC Union: No direct contact
Vox: At War, in a way. Often in conflict against them on human or skrell vessels. The few Unathi vessels aren't attacked usually as they almost never leave the home system.
