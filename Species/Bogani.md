# Ombedoyhe eef Bogani

From recon of their vessels, and bodies recovered from Skirmishes in the far Outer Rims of Human, and Skrellian space, the Bogani are a 
tall (somewhere around Eight feet, or 244cm). They are cyclopic in nature, with one central eye located around the middle of their 
elongated heads, which are quite large (the eye is as well). Their skin is more akin to the exoskeleton of a crustacean, with a light 
purple, or lilac, coloration. Their inner systems are quite different, and we still aren’t sure on how they work overall, but they are most 
definitely not mammalian in nature- not anything that Humanity has ever seen in terms of Biological makeup. All Prisoners of War that have 
been captured up to this point have committed suicide before questions could ever be posed. 

 Since their attack on the Positronic Union, more and more has been learned by these mysterious, violent aliens. They are, as far as we are 
aware, based around a single Faith, and is their reason for conquest and destruction of other species. To them, they are the only actual 
being of life in the universe, 'the light of it all,' and everything else is part of the darkness and evil. Their armies are incredibly 
devout, and highly advanced in their make up, using various enslaved species as well. If a soldier gets injured they won't go to help them, 
instead expecting them to handle it themselves or die. 

Most of the populace of conquered places is killed, with only small parts being taken for the purpose of enslavement along side what ever 
other creatures and civilizations they've taken in the past. 
  
On their vessels we’ve also been able to find what appears to be fighting pens, where we can only assume they have matches and battles for 
the crew to watch, as there is a spectator-like area around it. Along with these are holding cells which are most likely used for slaves. 
These two areas make up an entire level of the ship, which we can only assume means that they are very important in “Bogani” culture.

Their weaponry seems to be, for the most part, laser based, with pulsar cannons or something of the sort on their vessels. Their ships are 
as well, very advanced compared to any seen before. The drives that allow them to use bluespace are of a far more complex and advanced make 
up than what Humanity or Skrell uses, and we can not understand how they are able to make them work without a fire up process, transferring 
in and out in one seamless instance. Most if not all ships are equipped with stealth technology, and pods to attach onto the sides of 
vessels they attack. At first we believed them to be one of the Vox using stolen Skrell tech, but we were wrong. We can’t tell how their 
engines work, at all, being of such a design that it would make the most brilliant in Human Engineering drool.

Their conquest of the Positronic Union is incredibly dangerous if it happens completely, and their continuous attacks on the edges of the 
Human and Skrell space means that the Imperiate are the greatest threat to Life we have ever seen before.
