# Giant Armoured Serpentids

Synopsis:
-------------

Giant armoured serpentids (GAS) are characterised by the fundamental differences in the way they learn compared to humans. They don’t learn by hearing about something, but instead by watching a member of their own species do a task. Other than this, they have barely any creativity and terrible problem solving skills. They are born in batches of 200-300 of which only 2-4 live to the age of 4, the age where the adult members consider them people and as a species are highly sociable.

Physically, although they look intimidating, they aren’t very good at handling situations where they aren’t in control. If they catch prey off guard they can easily kill it, but if they’re the ones surprised they are unable to defend themselves and struggle to fight back. As such, they would much rather run or hide than fight back in such a case.

Roleplaying Guide:
-------------

The giant armoured serpentids as a species have a unique mentality that will make roleplaying as them a challenge. To help, I've done some theory crafting about how their mentality and background will affect their behaviour on the torch.

### Speech:

The speech pattern is one of the most important things to work on. It could take some practice to write in the correct style. Please don't hesitate to message the current maintainer for giant armoured serpentids if you would like someone to see how well you're doing.

When most adult humans talk, they subconsciously optimise their sentence structure. Using longer words and complex phrasing is common. Giant armoured serpentids aren't very good at this. They will split each thought or piece of information into a small segment, stringing them together using conjunctions like *and* *but* and *or*.

For example, where a human might say: Today I went to store to buy eggs, but it was closed since it was so hot. I went home empty handed.

A giant armoured serpentid might say: Today I went to the store and I was buying eggs and it was very hot so the store was closed so I went home and I didn't get to buy eggs.

They both communicate the same information, but the giant armoured serpentid sounds almost like it's rambling. The sentence structure is technically correct grammatically but stylistically it does poorly. The giant armoured serpentid also uses short and simple words. They typically won't use complex adjectives, but will instead use an adverb with a simple adjective.

Notice there is no stuttering and no redundancy. They use run on sentences but don't repeat themselves. They also speak clearly and distinctly. Though their voice sounds slightly tinny through the speaker, they do have a tone of voice which, although similar, is distinguishable by those who have practised.

#### TL;DR

##### DO:
- Use lots of small thoughts
- The word *and* is your best friend
- Avoid complex grammar and language

##### DON'T:
- Stutter or slur your words
- Use incorrect grammar or made up words
- Repeat ideas or be redundant

### Behaviour:

When considering how you'll react to things when playing a giant armoured serpentid there are a couple of things to keep in mind. One of the most important is considering which external experiences and personal behaviours are new and which they have experienced or have been extinguished.

There are a lot of things "wild" (here on called unacclimated) giant armoured serpentids do. For example, one social behaviour is they help groom others in their colonies.

You are not playing an unacclimated giant armoured serpentid though, exclusively acclimated (have gone through the research program) giant armoured serpentids will be playable. You need to view all of their natural behaviours through this lens.

Yes, giant armoured serpentids groom each other. However, think of what the research team would have done had one of the giant armoured serpentids attempted to groom them. The goal of the researchers is to train giant armoured serpentids to live with humans. They would know that grooming humans would be seen as unacceptable and would tell them not to do it (the fact their mouths are like garburators/garbage disposals to flesh doesn't help either).

This would also include many items around the ship. They likely will have seen a mech before and all the research equipment. The rest would be job-based.

They are unlikely to have ever touched a gun or been involved in any kind of fighting. Flashes, stun grenades, tasers, hardsuits, and many more things would be totally alien to them

Mostly items used for negative things or to inflict things on others would be unknown. While they went through extensive training, they are valuable creatures and would be sheltered from much of the negativity of humanity. This would also include people being mean or cruel to them.

#### TL;DR

##### DO:
- Remember you're not wild; weird social behaviours will have been stopped by the researchers
- Consider whether you'd have experienced something before you react
- Keep in mind, if your character wasn't a good candidate they never would have been sent to the torch

##### DON'T:
- Make large social errors or faux pas
- Act jaded or emotionless
- Be a dick to people

### Learning and Memory:

So, you can learn perfectly by watching alone. Yeah ok, but there are some hard limits to this. For this next chunk, when talking about perfect learning etc., I mean of normal behaviours, not useless behaviours. Those are a whole other ball game.

First, you can only learn from watching your own species. Watching a human do something isn't going to be the least bit helpful. If a human wants to teach you to do something you don't know at all, they're going to have to grab your arms and help move you to the right spot. You don't have the right neurones to learn from watching humans.

Your learning is perfect, yeah, but your memory is limited. The behaviours you know, you remember perfectly. There is no "yes I think that I'm able to do this thing". You know it or you don't: binary. After observing a new behaviour you have about an hour to decide if you're going to keep it. Also if you don't practice your behaviours, you lose them in a couple of days. Since there's only so much time to practice, you know a very specialised skillset. You're not going to know how to set up an engine because you saw someone do it once a week ago.

Also, keep in mind that while you have the skills to do your job, you will lack some level of knowledge relating to those skills. If you're a chemist, you'd be super good at mixing chemicals. You'd know which chemicals and in which proportions mix to make what and how to do so. You will likely be able to recite facts about each one, like dylovene being a broad antitoxin. But if someone walks into the infirmary puking and saying they sting, you'll have no clue that they're likely suffering from toxins. If they're coughing blood and gasping you won't make the connection that you should probably give them peridaxon and dexalin plus. Especially with the new medical system where things are more obfuscated.

In the case where you are caught out not knowing something, you're not going to panic or try something out. You lack the intellectual creativity that humans have for problem-solving. There's no "that didn't work, let's think of what to do next". If you, ICly, don't know what to do, go ask someone else for help. You seek leadership and direction from those who are more capable.

Remember too that you have great interpersonal skills. Socially, you remember a great deal and are quite in tune with both your emotions and those of humans. These social connections aren't behaviours and so are processed differently in your brain so aren't subject to the same restrictions as your memory for behaviours.

#### TL;DR

##### DO:
- Seek others for help when your character doesn't know what to do
- Forget information not vital to your job between rounds
- Make friends and remember people, they aren't covered by the behaviour system

##### DON'T:
- Come up with solutions to problems
- Experiment or try new things
- Know skills out of your niche
- Use IC events as an excuse to know information your character shouldn't
- Learn things from watching humans

Finally, although rounds are not canon, please don't move one giant armoured serpentid character between multiple jobs. Each is trained to do one specific job on the Torch and they can't switch. If you play that character in another job, they have to be an entirely different person completely separate from the other one. I recommend using different characters or at least changing your name.

Biology and Biological History:
-------------

*GAS and human height comparison, art by Strider Den, http://striderden.deviantart.com/*

All serpentid species have four arms, no legs, and long snakelike bodies. Their two sets of arms each have vastly different functions. Their larger scythelike pair is used for hunting prey and when not in use, can be tucked in and held tightly against their bodies. The second set is smaller and proportioned more similarly to those of humans. They have three fingerlike appendages, each called a tarsus, on the ends of the foremost segment of these arms which allow them to pick up and manipulate tools and objects. When their hunting arms are folded, they can bring their grasping arms forward and use them normally. When using their hunting arms, their grasping arms are unable to be effectively used.

They have a pair of antennae, the average length of which varies by species. They use these to display emotion and as a form of crude communication between members of the non-sapient species. They are very sensitive to heat and can detect minor changes in the temperature of the environment. Giant armoured serpentids no longer use them to communicate directly, but instead, they react to any emotions felt by the owners. These are often unconscious like the facial expressions of humans.

Moving their arms requires the use of a hydraulic fluid as well as an underlying muscular structure. They can grip things in their hunting arms with extreme strength, the sharp spines piercing into prey to help them hold onto it while it struggles. This power requires them to divert fluid from their grasping arms to their hunting arms, causing them to drop anything they might have been holding beforehand. As ambush predators, they lash out to catch unaware prey which they then masticate with their sharp mouthparts, chewing off flesh and limbs. They can also attempt to crush their prey in their forearms and damage it internally. If they are unable to grab onto prey, such as if tape was put around their forelimbs, they would be nearly harmless and likely cause at most minor bruising even to a still target. Regardless of tape, they have difficulty coping with hectic combat situations and will go into their hide/threat/run routine if they miss or lose their grip.

Eggs are laid in batches of 200-300 at a time. Small nymphs, each about four inches long, hatch from each egg. These nymphs are wingless and will moult several times before adulthood. After about four years from hatching, when they grow wings and become adults though they don’t reach full size for several more years. While the wings work well on the smaller serpentids, giant armoured serpentids are very poor fliers on their native planet and are unable to fly in the thinner atmosphere and higher gravity of human stations and ships.

GAS’s native planet used to have an atmosphere that was very rich in oxygen, necessary for creatures without lungs like serpentids that use spiracles and tracheae for oxygen to get large. The atmosphere was thick and heavy with a minor amount of phoron present. All the organisms on the planet absorb small amounts of phoron which is stored in their bodies. The higher an organism is on the food chain the more phoron they contain in their system, like mercury in fish, though it isn’t toxic to the organisms at the levels it reaches naturally. As the number of animals grew, less and less oxygen was available in the atmosphere and although the atmosphere is still more dense and higher in oxygen than human preferences, most of the giant insect-like species died out. Those that didn’t become smaller over time in order to have enough oxygen. Since then, some of the species have developed alternative oxygen strategies and begun to grow larger again, topping out at around the size of a large dog such as a St. Bernard or a Burmese Mountain Dog. However, GAS were unique in developing their own strategy and never shrunk from their original size of an average 15 feet in total length, with their heads around eight or nine feet off of the ground.

Although it wasn’t enough to ignite in the atmosphere, the small amounts of phoron in the air caused fires on this planet to rage much stronger and hotter than those in a normal atmosphere. As a result, serpentids have developed an instinctive phobia of uncontrolled fires which causes them to escape as quickly as they can. This wouldn’t apply to things like the supermatter which is contained, or a welding torch which is highly focused. However, a classic lighter with its exposed and flickering flame would be intimidating to them.

While GAS have all the standard serpentid traits, they also have traits unique to their species, especially as they diverged from the other serpentids so far back. While they are in the same taxonomical order as the rest of the serpentids, they are the only species in their family and the only species which is sapient.

The unique oxygen strategy of the giant armoured serpentid relies on using the phoron stored from both the air and from the food they eat. They create acetone using a special organ to extract components from what they eat and the air, mixing it with phoron to create acetone. This is used to supplement the insufficient oxygen they get from the air around them and enables them to live in areas, like human ships and bases, with even lower oxygen levels and pressure than their home planet. They store sufficient phoron to last for months or years but need to create acetone frequently to maintain their level of dexalin. Theoretically, they wouldn’t need dexalin in an environment with sufficient levels of oxygen at a high enough pressure.

Giant armoured serpentids, as can be assumed, have a thick armoured exoskeleton which is very strong. It has a series of iridophores over the surface which allows them to adaptively blend into their environment with extreme precision. This requires the precise control the cells, and as such isn’t something they can do consciously. Their skin changes when they’re hiding, when they’re putting on a threat display, or when they’re performing some of the “useless behaviours” in their mating rituals which will be expanded on in another section. Minor adjustments, not visible to unaided human eyes, in the current colour also signal changing emotions.

GAS have fantastic eyesight, even in very dark conditions due to their two large compound eyes set wide enough on their heads to give them a 360-degree view around them. Each individual section of the compound eye has a tapetum lucidum, a special reflective backing which allows them to see better in the dark in the same way cats do. This, however, makes them vulnerable to sudden bright lights such as flashes. A flash will temporarily blind them and while their vision will mostly recover, without medical attention their eyes will be permanently damaged. Luckily, they have two nearly opaque lenses that they can slide down over their eyes to protect them from bright lights such as fires. Though effective, these lenses make the giant armoured serpentid using them blind farther than about a meter away. They do not use them to blink or to clean their eyes but instead must clean their eyes manually as a part of the grooming process.

Mentality:
-------------

Giant armoured serpentids are a social species with a different sort of intelligence than humans. If we’re following the 9 types of intelligence system, they have good intra-personal, interpersonal, and special intelligences and a level of bodily-kinesthetic intelligence that would be impossible for humans to achieve without augmentation. They would have a terrible logical-mathematical intelligence and lack the creativity and adaptability of humans. They are virtually incapable of high-level problem solving the way that humans problem solve.

They are highly social and thousands of years ago they were a colony insect-like bees or ants, though with several unique mechanisms. Queens were capable of high-level problem solving and led colonies of individuals, physically demonstrating complex solutions to encountered problems which the others would be able to learn almost immediately. When the oxygen levels dropped, the constant state of suffocation they lived in prevented and damaged the complex neural systems of the queens. As a result, they diverged from the colony structure and while they no longer have a queen, they still retain many of the same instincts and behaviours that would benefit hive workers. They work well in teams and are highly coordinated, they can communicate and discuss their intentions, and they easily learn behaviours from each other.

GAS’s lack of problem-solving skills, while frustrating, wasn’t seen as a big deal. They had never met a species that could solve problems like that so they didn’t know they were lacking. After the introduction to humans, they have become very aware of their shortcomings as a species. This leads to a high level of frustration when they are unable to solve a novel problem. They are quite receptive to solutions offered by other species and those they see as being intelligent and, when conflicting solutions to a problem are given, they will typically follow the ones given by the person they believe is more intelligent as they lack the ability to assess the effectiveness of the instructions by their own merits.

Serpentids are cowardly at heart and while they look strong and tough, they are poor fighters. Their intense camouflage has made them fantastic ambush predators, but they lack the mental flexibility to react in a fight where an opponent will behave in an unexpected and usually unique way. When startled, they involuntarily go into hiding mode. Their whole body freezes for several seconds and their camo kicks in, attempting to hide them. This reflex gives them time to decide whether they should run, stay hidden, or try to look scary and intimidate what they were startled by.

The threat display consists of flaring out their wings and their skin changing colour in a wavelike pattern. They hold their arms up to look big and use their wings to make a loud buzzing sound. If this too fails, they will attempt to escape the threat as without the element of surprise they are unable to fight effectively.

Language:
-------------

Because GAS are so visual, any language they developed was bound to have a visual component to it.

Their language is a mixture of visual and audio signals, though they don’t work together. Rather, the two are independent of each other and the language can be fully understood if you can only hear it or if you can only see it. This is because of the clicking, grinding, and buzzing sounds involved each have a unique mouth movement that produces it. GAS can “read lips” in this fashion or rely on the audio, though the audio component is not as understandable and leads to more mistakes understanding what the other person is saying.

Mammalian, reptilian, or amphibious species would be unlikely to be able to produce the correct sounds and they definitely wouldn’t be able to produce the correct visuals for the language. However, the sounds can be easily reproduced by machines and are easily translatable by translation devices.

Because they can’t be pronounced by humans and because the sounds to create them are abstract and without meaning, the names they use for themselves lack an equivalent in human language.

Serpentids also are unable to produce the sounds to speak in any language but their own. Human sign language isn’t possible either as, with only three “fingers”, they don’t have the ability to make certain signs. They are physically able to communicate in Siik'tajr but at this point have no reason to know it.

Since GAS can't make the sounds that humans use for their languages, a robotic speaking device has been developed for them. They can control this device to make the sounds needed to speak in Galactic Common. This isn't translated and each GAS needs to know how to speak and understand the language for the voicebox to have any use.

When they speak in other languages, they speak correctly but inefficiently. They use many smaller words and string together many thoughts into run on sentences. Their grammar is correct but their style is awkward and clunky. For example, if one of them needed to express that someone named John Doe had threatened them with a lighter in the mess hall it may sound something like "I was in the mess hall and John Doe was too and he had a lighter and he took it and lit it and then he threatened me with it.".

Learning:
-------------

Let’s look at an example of a vending machine to see the limits of how this new species learns. If they needed to learn how to use a vending machine, giving them verbal instructions would be useless. The easiest way to learn would be to watch another member of their species use the machine. After seeing them use it once, they’d be able to use it in the exact same way that the one they watched did, able to precisely mimic the exact movement made by their fellow. However, they wouldn’t be able to use any other machines or even do something different on the same machine. After watching a member of their species use different machines in different ways multiple times, they’d be able to generalise this behaviour and then use most reasonable vending machines.

This generalisation process becomes better the more different ways they use or see used any behaviour.

If something goes wrong with the machine though, such as the first time it doesn’t accept the card or if the snack gets stuck, the new species would be incapable of reasoning what to do next. A human might shake the machine, press the button again, reach a hand up the machine, or any number of different strategies. Instead, the new species would become frustrated, particularly now that they’re aware humans would likely be able to fix the issue. They may attempt doing random actions such as waving their arms or making noises at the machine but they won’t follow any kind of logical structure. This, however, is a last resort and they are much more likely to ask and see if anyone around them knows how to solve the situation before they resort to their crude trial and error. If someone does know how, they need the behaviour demonstrated to them and can’t be taught with words alone.

Because so many of them are born at once, most of the things they had learned naturally were a result of generations of randomly guessing what the right thing to do was. While it’d be almost impossible for a single new species member to figure out how to get their snack from the vending machine, even if they tried for weeks at a time, thousands each trying on different vending machines would eventually find one way to fix the problem. All the others would then watch it do this behaviour and the next time their snack got stuck in that same way, they could all successfully retrieve it with the new method they learned but only from that one machine. After they learn how to retrieve snacks in the same way from several machines, they would be able to generalise the snack retrieval behaviour and retrieve snacks stuck in that exact way from even a machine they had never seen before.

In an average 40-year lifespan, each new species member is likely to discover about 5-10 different novel solutions to problems they encounter.

However, they can be taught by humans, just not by watching or listening to them. A human can physically manipulate one of them in order to show them what motions need to be performed. To teach a member of new species to use a vending machine, the human would move their arm and use it to push the right buttons or insert change or whatever else needs to be done. When they’re done, the new species member can then repeat that behaviour and others watching it do the behaviour will learn it too.

Though they can learn quickly, they need to rehearse the behaviours they have in order to remember them. Unlike human memory, these behaviours are very binary. They will be able to remember how to do I and be able to do it or they won’t, there’s no in between where they “kind of” remember and are liable to make mistakes because of it. The more they practice daily, the more behaviours on average they can hold. This seems to be influenced by the complexity of the behaviours and each individual may be more or less good than another at storing behaviours. This means they tend to specialise in a field and stay with it as knowing all the behaviours of one job is more useful than knowing a few behaviours from many different jobs.


Culture:
-------------

While the culture of giant armoured serpentids seems to be lacking, it is more influential than it seems. Because of how they learn behaviours differently, colonies of the new species have different behaviours for the same tasks. Sometimes, behaviours can be traced back to a forking point such as when a colony split into two and research has been done about how the behaviour has changed in each colony.

As mentioned above, each member of the species can only remember so many behaviours. This has led to an interesting metric for finding a good mate. Each new species member has what, in their language, are called “useless behaviours”. These behaviours have no skill benefit but are used as a way to demonstrate overall competence. By having behaviours that don’t directly benefit their survival, they’re essentially saying “Hey look at me, I can know so many things that I don’t need all I know to be useful. I can survive while storing, maintaining, and practising this otherwise useless thing”. It has become a general fitness metric that they use to determine who is a desirable mate.

These behaviours on the surface seem similar to dancing in human culture but are fundamentally different. Each individual has their own unique set of movements that they have developed by adjusting and incorporating movements from other behaviours they know and have witnessed and it their only known creative outlet. These movement sets are incredibly complex and require a mastery over their movements. The more technically skilled the movements are, combined with how well they do them, the more attractive they are as an individual. Of course, appearance and personality do come into account, but a new species member who is unable to maintain useless behaviours is seen as being unfit to reproduce as they don’t have the ability to know enough behaviours.

Additionally, when performing these useless skills, their skin flashes in waves of black and white, cascading over them and making them mesmerising. Both males and females need these useless skills as, other than reproductive compatibility, there is no fundamental difference either physically or culturally between the sexes.

This happens on an annual basis and they are only fertile for a short amount of time. All eggs for the year are laid at once and the young from that year grow up together, having hatched at most a week apart. This means they also moult all at once, growing their wings and becoming a part of the colony they select (usually the one nearest to them, which is also often the one their parents are from).

Serpentids, in general, have a very different view on their young than that of mammals. Mammals typically rely on the tactic of focusing their resources on raising a few young to adulthood while serpentids use sheer numbers. Though fundamentally social creatures, serpentids don’t see their young as part of their social group until they grow their wings. The giant armoured serpentids have terms in their language that relate to this, roughly translating to mindfull: having a mind, and mindless: not having a mind. They view mindless things like animals, trees, and their own young as being on the same level and mindfull things, like themselves as adults and the adults of other sapient races, as being on the same level. They have no instincts to protect or help their young and are unlikely to be convinced otherwise.

In fact, most colonies practice a form of eugenics on their young. If a nymph is physically unfit they will typically leave it alone, letting nature take its course. If a nymph is mentally or socially unfit, the adults will often intervene upon noticing one of several behavioural flags and cull the nymph in question. This includes things like stealing from, bullying, or fighting with other nymphs. While the adults are all at the same level, they know that each year of nymphs will become a social group and those kinds of unproductive behaviours aren’t desirable if they live long enough to become mindfull. Even so, an adult abusing the young or interfering by assisting is looked very poorly upon by the other members of the colony.

If adults practice unproductive behaviours or otherwise intentionally interfere with the success of the colony as a whole, the colony will ostracise and exclude the offender. They will ignore the offender and pretend that they aren’t there and that the things they do are unnoticed. The offender then usually leaves the colony and goes solo, having been recognised as being unfit for colony life. If instead, the offender becomes violent, the colony will turn on the offender and attack them on sight.

Contact:
-------------

17 years ago, the new species was discovered accidentally when a small group SolGov Defense Force members were sent to assist a research company in securing a small planet on the edge of SolGov territory for research operations. The first pass over the planet, which consisted of mostly plains and jungles, didn’t show signs of hostile life. A few mammal-like animals that seemed to be herbivores but seemingly no large predators. They were wrong.

As they made a quick pass through the nearby jungle, they were about ready to give the all clear when a large creature lashed out at them from the underbrush. Looking like a massive insect, it grabbed one of the army members in its forelimbs and attempted to quickly end their life. Fortunately for the soldier, it didn’t seem to understand his armour, its horrid mouth parts grating against his protective gear and tearing through a large chunk of it. As the soldiers began to shoot beside it in an attempt to frighten it, it stopped. Terrified man still in its clutches, the creature froze, skin shifting colour to blend back into the vegetation behind it. Even as the soldiers approached it remained statuesque and, not wanting to risk injuring the soldier further, they called the researchers for help.

They managed to retrieve the creature and the soldier and brought them to the temporary facility, using metal wedges and crowbars to pry the man out of her clutches. They began an intensive study of this creature, catching more of its kin in the jungle, mostly with lures as the creatures were all but impossible to find otherwise. The researchers had already discovered and named some other species of serpentid but never as large or as strong as these, dubbing them the giant armoured serpentids. When they had several together, they seemed to be making a large number of clicking, buzzing, and grinding sounds with their mouth parts. After a few months of tracking, they began to recognise patterns in this and after a year of working with them, they finally started to glean meaning from the strange language the creatures were speaking. Once each knew the other was sapient, the one who had originally captured the soldier expressed genuine regret at her actions and apologised much to the surprise of the researchers. No longer confined, news of this new human species spread like wildfire around the giant armoured serpentid colonies.

After realising how these creatures functioned and getting a good estimate of the number of them on the planet, they realised that they could be taught to preform useful tasks around the base. Even stranger, some of the young observing started to help in these tasks without themselves being taught how to do it. Seeing the potential these creatures had for cheap labour, even highly technical labour like station repair or surgery, they began a 15-year pilot project to train them as workers. Until this project, dubbed the Giant Armoured Serpentid Project (GASP), was completed, it was held top secret and no species other than some humans know of their existence. Rumours do spread though and stories of the giant bug monsters have likely spread through the branches of the SolGov Defense Forces after the man who was captured and almost killed returned from the planet.
