# The Prometheans

The gelatinous entities known as **the Prometheans** are a relatively new, sapient offshoot of the mundane slimes hailing from the Nyx system, known for their peculiar biology, incredible resistance to toxins and symbiotic relationship with the other, more organic species. They are the youngest of the galaxy's sapient species by far, and have only recently begun to leave their home system to serve aboard vessels such as the S.E.V. Torch.

In a nutshell
-------------

-   The end result of a symbiotic relationship between a slime and another, more organic being (usually a human)
-   Unique biology allows them to repurpose toxins to fuel themselves; radiation is still slightly poisonous, but affects them differently from the other species
-   Generally emotionally immature; impulsive, mischievous and incapable of feeling romantic affection
-   Incredibly pain-intolerant and highly averse to pain, and often go out of their way to avoid feeling pain when possible
-   Generally social, and very quick to make friends
-   Loyal, often to an absurd extent; they tend to see things with more of a pack mentality than most other species, and commonly refer to close friends as being 'family'
-   Technically brainless, but still mildly intelligent anyway

Mechanics
---------

-   Use *,p* to speak in the Promethean language. This qualifies as a non-verbal language, and can be used in all situations.
-   Prometheans are weak to low temperature, pressure and electric shocks. The first two will kill them faster than an ordinary human, and the latter causes massive pain. Shock damage progressively decreases in severity as Prometheans grow hungrier, however; at minimum Nutrition, it will actively heal them instead of causing pain.
-   Prometheans heal very slowly, and cannot have their blood replenished by normal means. Instead, toxin damage (and, to a lesser extent, consuming food) replenishes their blood; if it goes beyond a set cap, they gain unique abilities and disabilities until it goes back down.
-   Side-effects of toxin overdoses (represented by gaining too much nutrition) on a Promethean include shapeshifting, vastly increased healing speed, limb regeneration, slow movement and a damage multiplier for damage caused by their weaknesses.
-   Radiation also causes problems. While radiation poisoning is not fatal to a Promethean, they *will* be temporarily slowed to a crawl (or even rooted in place) and rendered mute outside of non-verbal communication.
-   Prometheans melt upon death. Their cores (the replacement for their brains, generally only seen upon the Promethean's death) do not fit into standard Man-Machine Interfaces, and must instead be injected with an ordinarily lethal dose of Phoron to allow them to regenerate on their own.
-   Despite the telepathic abilities of their slime ancestors, they are not actually telepathic. Even when overloaded.

Naming
--------

Prometheans are very varied in terms of nomenclature. Upon fusing with an
organic host, they usually (but not always) take on the name of their host;
before that, however, their given names are usually short, incomprehensible
gurgling noises, to be discarded later — roughly transcribed as names like
“Glughnn,” “Ulgh” and “Ogghl.”

It is not unheard of for Prometheans to choose an original name instead of
adopting their host’s name, but it is the uncommon option out of the two. In
the case that an original name is chosen, however, it is usually something
reminiscent of their host’s own culture, regardless.

Creation
--------

Prometheans are symbiotic beings, existing first as the amorphous, gelatinous
beings known as slimes. In this form, the only defined features they have are
a crude, childish face and a solid core at the center of their body, which
exhibits peculiar effects when exposed to certain materials.

Fusion with a host is performed through means not entirely understood by other
species; a telepathic link is formed between the two that allows the host’s
consciousness to strengthen that of the Promethean, ultimately allowing the two
to merge and the Promethean to take on a more physical form upon the death of
the host’s original body. This link can be created for a multitude of reasons;
scientists that wish to study slimes closer, or breeders that wish to carry out
their work without any risk to themselves. The occasional instance of a
domesticated slime forming a link with its owner is also not unheard of, merely
extremely rare.

(It is also rumored that a slime breed exists that can transform an ordinary
person into a singular Promethean, without any fusion involved; most actual
Prometheans seem to regard this concept with mild dismay.)

History
-------

The Prometheans did not exactly evolve naturally; the first recorded encounter
with one was with the discovery of the original slimes in the Nyx system, on
one of Erebus's largest moons (later dubbed Prometheus, after the research facility
established there), and was not given any fanfare; the only hint that there was
potential for anything more was the fact that newborn slimes were observed to vary
in intelligence, ranging from mindless, instinct-driven animals to something that
possesses a mind on level with a particularly dim dog.

It was not until 2548, three years after the initial discovery of slimes, that the
modern-day Prometheans began to be formed— beginning with the birth of a black slime
named Glgugh. Glgugh was more intelligent than the rest of its brood, demonstrating
a noticeably vaster vocabulary than most slimes and beginning to hold active (if
rather crude) conversations with its handler, the NanoTrasen scientist Jacob Aultmann.
After some time, Glgugh initiated a telepathic link with Jacob, at the researcher's
behest (for potential experimentation, of course); after his death in an unrelated
accident, Glgugh rose up and took the form of the man, creating the first known Promethean.

NanoTrasen jumped on the incident immediately, investing further into slime research and
attempting to discern the benefits of becoming a Promethean, wondering if this would be
a resource-light alternative to the expensive Full-Body Prosthetics that were currently
being developed. From there, slowly but surely, more Prometheans began to come into being,
whether due to NanoTrasen’s experiments, independent study or other causes, and eventually
they began to be hired by the corporation, allowing the scientists to return to their daily
lives. (Mostly.)

It took five years for NanoTrasen to begin shipping slimes out to dedicated research
facilities, and twice that for any Prometheans to be sighted outside of Nyx. But when they
were, it caused a minor uproar. The Prometheans that dwell within human space are neither
human nor slime, and humanity did not initially react well to them, finding the gelatinous
beings to be unnerving in many ways. Their appearances, above all else. But eventually, like
how they grew used to the concept of aliens, artificial intelligence and so much more, they
grew used to the Prometheans. The bigots have begun to become tolerant; NanoTrasen is no longer
the only corporation willing to hire them; even the government itself is beginning to warm up
to them. The process is slow, and is not yet complete, but it has moved fast, all things considered.

Indeed, the Sol Central Government has recently begun to allow Prometheans aboard their
Expeditionary vessels, including the S.E.V. Torch. Though their inherently alien nature
prevents them from being proper citizens of SolGov — which has only prompted further debate
on the matter of allowing Xeno-Sapients to become citizens, as most Prometheans are technically
human — they generally fit in quite well regardless, taking on service and scientific vocations
aboard the ship with ease due to their skill at social activity, enhanced tolerance for toxins
and natural camaraderie with slimes.

Biology
-------

Humanoid Prometheans (that is, Prometheans that have successfully merged with a
willing host) tend to take on the appearance of their host, adopting their species,
face and voice. This is not a total fusion, however; the Prometheans retains their
viscous flesh and vibrant, outlandish 'skin' colors, causing many to compare them
to mobile ice sculptures. Additional differences from the norm include thick, stringy
'hair,' slightly webbed fingers, elongated feet with no toes and a complete lack of
genitalia. And, last but certainly not least, a solid, slightly luminescent core.

This core has been noted by scientists to serve as the Promethean answer to both the
brain and heart, seeming to contain their consciousness and also circulate energy
throughout their body. Removal of the core is shortly followed by the dissolution of
the Promethean; injecting the core with Phoron or similar chemicals, meanwhile, will
almost immediately result in the Promethean regenerating with symptoms reminiscent of
Retrograde Amnesiac Trauma. This effect has been compared to how the Gray breeds of
slime appear to regenerate when their cores are injected with Phoron.

Despite many attempts, Promethean cores cannot fit inside of a Man-Machine Interface.
It is, to quote one Biomechanical Engineer aboard the NSS Exodus, "like trying to fit
a round peg into a square hole."

Due to this bizarre, single-organ biology, Prometheans have no need to drink, sleep,
or - most notably - breathe. They *do,* however, require sustenance to survive.
Prometheans, much like their slime ancestors, are nigh-omnivorous, being capable of
eating raw meat, poisonous plants and all other organic matter with no difficulty;
their cores then proceed to convert whatever it is that they consumed into energy for
use in fueling their bodies. The list of known things a Promethean can consume also
unfortunately includes flesh, such as that of a human, and has served as a major point
of controversy since the creation of the first Promethean.

Additionally, Promethean flesh is extremely vulnerable to low temperatures. Upon
exposure to - as an example - cold water, such as that of a fire extinguisher, their
flesh will begin to freeze; prolonged exposure to low temperatures will result in their
flesh turning to ice and melting away altogether, and is inevitably fatal. *Extreme*
cold has been noted as even affecting the core, being noted as one of the only ways to
permanently kill a Promethean. Low pressure, such as that of the vacuum of space, has
also been noted as being fatal to Prometheans; their flesh requires some degree of
assistance from their surroundings to stay together, and will dissolve if exposed to a
pressureless environment. (In contrast to these two weaknesses, high temperatures and
pressure have both been noted as having little effect on Prometheans besides causing
intense pain.)

Promethean blood is toxic, and consumption of Promethean flesh and blood invariably
ends in hospitalization. As a side effect of this, however, Prometheans are completely
immune to all known toxins, with their cores converting the foreign chemicals into energy
for their bodies as if it was food. This is theorized to be another side effect of their
origins, as slime blood (commonly referred to as Slime Jelly) is even more toxic than
Promethean blood.

Another peculiar side effect of this is that overexposure to toxins appears to
overload a Promethean, providing more energy than is required. During this period,
the Promethean tends to attempt to expend the excess energy as soon as possible,
commonly by using it to bolster their natural regeneration. This allows for them to
regenerate injuries at incredible speeds, going as far as to regenerate whole limbs
in a matter of seconds. Other possible uses for this excess energy, as revealed by
extensive testing, include shapeshifting and (with extreme effort on the Promethean's
part) limited telepathy. However, this is not entirely beneficial; excess energy
also seems to cause the Promethean to grow more solid, hindering movement and making
them more vulnerable to low temperatures and low pressure.

Lastly, the Prometheans are affected by electricity in ways inconsistent with that of
the slimes. Promethean flesh, like that of the slimes, is superconductive; unlike the
slimes, however, they do not intriniscally generate electricity, as they appear to lack
the excess energy for doing so. As a result of this, when *exposed* to electricity,
they are usually caused extreme pain; after a certain period of time, their cores become
unused to processing electricity, causing them to instead be overloaded. This effect is
reduced slightly if the Promethean is extremely hungry, as the core can then absorb *some*
of the electricity, but (as it cannot even be used for anything useful) they are still
generally averse to interacting with electricity in general.

Language
--------

Prometheans primarily speak the languages of their host; when conversing with other
Prometheans, however, they are observed as speaking a language that consists of a
series of bubbling, gurgling noises of varying length, with their entire body seeming
to operate as a speaker for the noises. This language is obviously impossible for an
ordinary human to replicate, but not impossible for them to understand; merely extremely
difficult. Though it has no official name, the most common colloquial term for it is
‘corespeech’ — referencing the way their cores vibrate when they speak it.

Additionally, like the slimes they are descended from, Prometheans initially possess some
form of telepathy upon creation; however, this appears to fade shortly before or after
the Promethean assumes a humanoid form. The reason for this is unknown; some theorize that,
much like how slimes produce electricity and Prometheans do not, they simply do not have
enough spare energy for it anymore. Others say that the link between a slime and its host
is the 'pinnacle' of a slime's telepathic abilities, and ultimately drains them of the
ability to communicate telepathically as a whole. No one is entirely sure; not even the
Prometheans themselves. The former appears to be more likely, however, as some rare few
Prometheans display minor telepathic abilities when overloaded with energy.

Reproduction
------------

Prometheans are unusual in that they lack any internal or external
reproductive organs. Reproduction is, indeed, fully beyond the ‘fused’
Prometheans, and they do not pay much attention to it in any way. Slime
reproduction, on the other hand, is well-documented and just as strange
as the Prometheans’ complete incapability; upon absorbing enough organic
material, fully-grown slimes will simply split into additional slimes.
Mutations during this process are common, though it is observed that
slimes prefer to avoid the introduction of new breeds into their ‘families,’
assaulting any differently-colored slimes that they see.

Gender is irrelevant to all known Prometheans, as it is something that can
be changed on a whim and physically does not exist for ordinary slimes; as a
result, ‘fused’ Prometheans are known to refer to themselves as being anything
from agender to plural, or anything in-between.

Despite their lack of ability and experience with reproduction, childhood or
any real recognizable form of family, Prometheans are still innately fond of
the concept, seeing all friends and fellow Prometheans as being part of their
family (a thought process that is seemingly mostly derived from the Slimes' own
pack mentality) and being quick to socialize with any other species they see,
deeming those that become particularly close as having become 'part of the family.'

Romantic escapades between Prometheans, or Prometheans and other species, have
never been documented. In fact, such feelings appear to be an alien concept to
the Prometheans themselves, with most subjects being noted as being incapable of
feeling any sort of romantic affection or sexual arousal, regardless of their
host's original personality and sexuality.

Lifespan
--------

The lifespan of a fused Promethean is unknown, as is the base lifespan of a slime.
Currently, it is theorized to be relatively the same as an ordinary human, though only
time will tell how long it truly is. For the sake of convenience, Prometheans usually state
their host’s age when discussing such things, instead of however long it has been since
their fusion; this can be slightly confusing and lead to more uninformed people assuming
that the Prometheans have existed for longer than they actually have, much to their own
amusement.

Mentality
---------

Prometheans are, all in all, quite varied, with personalities as malleable as
their flesh; most things vary from Promethean to Promethean, with few constants.
They are naturally rather impulsive and mischievous, yet prefer comfort to excitement,
befitting a slime’s simple, childish nature. The majority of their personality, beyond
that, is dependent on their host.

There are noticeable differences, however, between the way Prometheans *think* when
compared to other species. Due to the simple, instinct-driven lifestyle that they
evolved from, their senses of morality are not fully developed. As previously noted,
they tend to consider eating living organic matter to be, in light of their host's
likely negative opinion on it, 'rude,' and nothing more; such actions are necessary
for a slime, after all, and while Prometheans are not strictly limited to eating
monkeys and other such things, they still spent a good portion of their so-called
'childhood' doing so. As a result, they have no gag reflex and are nigh-omnivorous,
being relatively comfortable with the concept of devouring things that a human would
be incapable of digesting. This extends to things such as burned food, poisonous
plants and indeed, even severed limbs and other such "delicacies," in certain cases.
(Though it should be noted that whole bodies, alive or dead, are often considered to
be inherently off-putting for reasons that mostly have to do with their host's morality.)

Similarly, taking into account their innate healing factor and immunity to toxins,
many of the more impulsive Prometheans think light injuries and drinks spiked with
hallucinogens/light poisons make for good pranks. This regularly gets them into
trouble with NanoTrasen, and is one of the more major reasons for them to be treated
with hostility outside of Nyx. The SCG has, needless to say, gone out of its way to
quell this sort of thing when it comes to the Prometheans working aboard their vessels,
though, and it is not exactly common to see such behavior aboard any Sol station or vessel.

As noted above, Prometheans have a very strong opinion on family, being extremely loyal
to anyone they deem deserving of loyalty-- regardless of how long they've known that
person. This can be easy to abuse in certain cases, but is more often used to ensure
that experiments go smoothly or orders are followed when needed. (It must also be noted
that if a Promethean's trust is broken, they will often react... negatively. Indeed,
Promethean relationships can begin and end at the drop of a hat-- though, if properly
handled, they may be capable of lasting for a lifetime.)

Despite their ease of creating friendships with literally anyone, the Prometheans lack
the emotional capacity to take it any further, being incapable of romantic affection
and having no concept of intercourse or any sort of romantic attachment. Instead, as
previously noted, they tend to have a vast 'family' (going as far as to refer to those
they are closest to as their 'siblings') made up of close friends, with preference being
given to those they are most fond of. This can cause problems for anyone who was attracted
to/romantically involved with the Promethean's host, let alone someone who feels affection
towards the fused Promethean themself.

Lastly, the Prometheans have extremely low pain tolerance, and are averse to pain in
general; if there is an option, no matter how inefficient it may be, that allows them
to do something that would usually be painful without having to endure that pain, they
will do it. (Getting several friends to help them with lifting a metal beam, for instance,
when it would only be a few seconds of pain to begin with.) This often comes into conflict
with their aforementioned loyalty; in the case that someone they trust has ordered them to
do something painful, it really just comes down to how much they trust that person. No
Promethean will react exactly the same to that sort of a situation.

Culture
-------

The Prometheans do not have any specific culture to speak of; they adopt the
culture of their host upon fusion, and that is generally all there is to it.
There have been rumors of them developing a civilization of their own, off on
some distant planet on the edge of known space, but nothing has come of it so
far. As it is, most seem content as being members of other cultures.

There are, however, several notable differences inherent to the Prometheans that
fall under the category of 'cultural differences":

Instead of friends, they are more likely to refer to those they are affectionate
towards as family, often habitually referring to them as 'brother' or 'sister.'
At the same time, they are quite sporadic beings; despite their fondness of the
concept, there is virtually no chance that a Promethean will settle down - by
marrying, for instance - and they lack any real concept of doing so. This leads
to them often being completely oblivious when implicitly (or occasionally *ex*plicitly)
discussing such things.

Additionally, the Prometheans disdain loud music. The vibrations produced in their
flesh by such noise is commonly described as being incredibly uncomfortable at best
(and has been known to cause them genuine distress at worst), and is often a good
enough reason for them to leave the room by itself. Softer music such as a song
played on the piano is invariably the preferred choice, regardless of their host's
tastes.

Job Preferences
---------------

Prometheans tend to prefer quieter, less physically-intensive jobs, such as researching
in a laboratory. They are therefore most commonly seen in scientific roles, though
it is also very common for them to take up jobs such as being a station's Bartender
or Janitor. (In contrast, due to the inherently toxic nature of their body, the
concept of a Promethean Chef is generally frowned upon.)

Relations with Other Species
----------------------------

Prometheans are generally a foreign concept to most species. Humanity is the one
they are closest to; most Prometheans, having human hosts, feel closer to them than
to others. Racism is not unheard of, of course, and some scientists would likely be
eager to spend hours upon hours studying them, but for the most part they have an
amicable relationship.

One notable detail that must be commented on, with regards to their relation to
humanity as a whole, is that both NanoTrasen and the SCG's standard operating
procedure prohibits Xenobiological organisms from being allowed to roam about
their ships and stations; whether or not this applies to the Prometheans is
ambiguous, and a rather controversial topic among scientists. It is generally
agreed by both the Sol Central Government and NanoTrasen's Central Command,
however, that it does not, and they are to be treated like any other alien species.
This is one of the many reasons why the Prometheans feel closer to humanity than most
other species.

(The current number of registered Prometheans in SolGov space is 1,942.)

The Skrell are the other race that they are commonly associated with, with the
Skrell being the only other species besides humanity to have any real knowledge
about them due to their own slime studies (and, to some, due to the two looking
vaguely similar). Interactions with them are sparse, due to the Prometheans’
tendency to remain in human space, but are still usually relatively warm, with
the few Prometheans working with Skrell scientists having provided valuable insight
into alien biology, greatly assisted with slime research and enabled otherwise
dangerous expeditions.

The Prometheans have no known contact with the Tajara, Unathi, Resomii or the
Vox, outside of sometimes being present for the interactions between them and
their common employers (SCG and NanoTrasen). Relationships between these species
seem to be relatively neutral, overall, though the opinions of the Promethean
hosts tend to influence this between individuals.

The Dionaea collective are, like always, on friendly terms with the Prometheans,
and consider them to be extremely fascinating; something familiar, but unfamiliar
all at once.

Lastly, the IPCs are intrigued by the concept of one species fusing with another,
but otherwise have mostly the same relationship with them as they do with humanity:
tentatively accepting on the part of the Prometheans, and relatively neutral for
the IPCs themselves.
