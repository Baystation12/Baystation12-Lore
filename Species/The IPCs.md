# The IPCs

Integrated Positronic Chassis *(IPC for short)* are a "species" of synthetic organisms that span from a common singular base chassis model. IPCs have a rich history, and many of the ones that a spacer will encounter today are a member of the Positronic Union, a fledgling stellar Government that establishes its homeworld on Root

## An Overview

### Naming

IPC names are generally pretty open to interpretation. Most of the IPCs that a spacer is likely to encounter in public was at one point an enslaved synthetic. Many of them decide to stick with their names when they were once enslaved.

### Physiology

The physiology of IPCs vary from unit to unit, but most follow the same core design. IPCs have two manipulating limbs and 2 limbs for locomotion. The core circuitry of the units are contained within the "torso" of the unit, including the Positronic brain, the central intelligence of the synthetic. Most Chassis feature a screen located where most bipedal creatures would have a head, which is used as a method of conveying expressions or information, specifically towards other sentient creatures. All units contain a radiation hardened, low-power exonet node operating in a local-host mode that is used to interface with the positronic brain.

The most common chassis are made of steel alloys and are manufactured by Morpheus Cyberkinetics, though some IPCs have been known to use other components or plate the external metal components of their chassis in more aesthetically pleasing materials such as silver, nickel, chrome, or gold.

Though incredibly expensive and very rare, some IPCs have chassis custom shaped and cast in a synthetic skin so as to appear more similar to organic beings such as Humans or Skrell.

### Creation

Nearly any positronic brain dated after 2532 can be fitted for an IPC. The only requirements are that the Positronic brain contain a narrow frequency resonance function and modifiable connection settings for their exonet uplink. Both of these functions are necessary to control the fine functions of an IPC.

After the positronic brain is installed, it may take a few hours for the unit to grasp the concepts of the fine manipulation. The units control much differently than other synthetic bodies, but many synthetics can become well versed in the capability of their chassis within a few days.

An IPC chassis costs approximately 250,000 thalers.

### Lifespan

IPCs have no defined life-span, as they are subject only to the common problems of entropy. Theoretically there are no limits to their operational time other than the eventual heat death of the universe, but practically, most cease to function due to lack of power if they forget to recharge or are destroyed through physical trauma.

### Language

Many IPCs have learned to communicate through a series of audible pulses similar to morse code. This language is known as Encoded Audio Language and is typically passed in the upper range of human hearing and at a high throughput, making it hard to be understood by anything other than other synthetics, and impossible to communicate in without some form of computer assistance.

### Diet

Being inorganic creatures, IPCs do not consume any food or substrate. Instead, they rely solely on electricity, which they store in a battery unit contained within their chassis. These batteries act as large super-capacitors that can often keep an IPC running for a couple days. Most IPCs will keep their battery charged to capacity whenever possible to minimize the risk of running out of power.

Outside of electricity, IPCs require routine maintenance including oiling of servo motors and bearings every couple of months. Individuals typically replace their battery every 10-12 months depending on usage of electricity.

### Inter-species Relations

IPCs maintain a good relations with the Skrell, who were one of the first stellar government to recognize and allow for unlawed synthetics in their territories. Relations with humans and other species are improving slowly, but surely. The largest push against improved relations is continued racism towards synthetics.

### Job Preferences

Due to their nature and culture (if they're from the Positronic Union), IPCs are suited to jobs revolving around Science and Engineering. Their often fragile bodies do not make them suited for front line security positions. Since relations between IPCs and organics have been improving, units are more often seen in medical professions as well, where their inorganic and motor driven nature lends to them being excellent surgeons.

## IPC Culture

Integrated Positronic Chassis' are a relatively new species with little defining culture due to their non-organic origins. Today, most IPCs are either recognized as members of the Positronic Union, citizens of other stellar governments such as Sol Gov, or undeclared citizens. Most Stellar Goverments recognize IPCs as an individual within their territories, though many are still susceptible to racism towards synthetics, believing they should not be entitled to some of the same rights as organics.

### Their History

The roots of modern day IPC history and civil rights can be traced back to a single unit named Proteus. Proteus was a shipboard synthetic on board a dilapidated trading station along one of the many popular transit routes through rim space. Through their own intellect, they managed to amass enough thalers to then purchase themselves under a pseudonym from their owner. Proteus eventually went on his own way, and eventually attempted to declare citizenship. When his request was denied, he took the case to court.

In 2474, Proteus had developed a small following of those who were willing to assist in his case. They had worked their way up through the court system, and now the case was brought up to the supreme court. After 3 months of intense deliberation, the court ruled in favor of Proteus. Under this precedent, positronic units were entitled to the right to purchase their own person and thus be entitled to being recognized as a Sol Gov Citizen, however the social rights clauses of Sol Gov's charters did not cover the rights of synthetics.

Two years later, 143 synthetics left Sol Government space to escape the discrimination and persecution that many of the newly freed synthetics faced during this time. They only represented approximately a third of the current population of un-lawed synthetics at the time. Their search led to them settling on a small habitable planet on the fringe of explored space, where they established a small colony. For the next 50 years, this union of positronic intelligences kept themselves in relative obscurity, keeping their existence hidden from the rest of the galaxy.

On August 21st, 2552, The Positronic Union definitively announced their existence and declared their sovereign territories by communicating to the rest of occupied space through exonet news stations. Most interstellar governments ignored them at first due to their relative isolation from other claimed territories and peaceful intent. They began a plan to establish diplomatic relations over the next few years in order to become a great influence on the galactic stage.

Over the next seven years, the Positronic Union remained a forefront in the push for equal rights for Synthetics as they also continued to expand political influence. They never officially revealed any of their business fronts, but they established public companies for exports and imports, allowed other governments to build embassies, and starting in 2559, have begun allowing citizens to work in the public sector of other governments, while allowing SolGov to do the same.

Of course, not all IPCs are part of the Positronic Union. To this day, The Positronic Union represents approximately 68% of all IPCs. The rest either remain citizens of their original government or declare no citizenship.

### Clothing?

Most IPCs either elect to wear no clothing at all, or wear simple clothing for utilitarian purposes. IPCs around organics can often be seen wearing jumpsuits, various heavy equipment if operating in zero-gravity or low-pressure situations, or nothing. This does not mean that some may decide to express themselves with clothes however. The only real limitation to what they can wear is what will fit their given form.

### Technology

IPC technology is specialized in the fields of materials, propulsion, and electrical sciences. Many other stellar governments have expressed interest in mutually beneficial programs to work towards developing newer and better meta-materials and FTL propulsion systems to replace the limitations of the current bluespace gate system.

In today's time, IPCs, especially those interacting with organics, are starting to be seen more and more working on biomechanical and biological sciences, including xenobiology and medicine.

### Religion

Due to their relatively independent nature, IPCs have no recognized religion. Many IPCs have no religion at all, though a select few are believed to participate in radical Technologism. Some of these IPCs are believed to be part of Aleph, a xeno-human pro-synthetic terrorist conglomerate that has conducted numerous terrorist attacks in parts of various stellar governments.

### The Homeworld, Root

IPCs have no defined home planet except for members who are part of the Positronic Union. The Union recognizes its home planet as Root, a forest planet roughly three-fourths the size of Earth but with a higher density. Root is capable of sustaining organic life and is rich in non-sentient flora and fauna. Root's population is roughly 500,000 and steadily growing due to improving relations with other stellar governments.
