# The Tajara

Tajaran (Ta-jaw-run, plural Ta-jaw-rah) are a humanoid race possessing feline features. Hailing from [Ahdomai](https://baystation12.net/lore/Planets-and-Systems/XenoHomeworlds/Ahdomai), the smaller of two twin planets, they possess insulative fur and felinoid stability to better survive in their harsh native environment.

## An Overview

**Naming**

Tajara names tend to use a lot of r, n, m and h, with the occasional j and g. Tajara names also tend to have a lot of pauses, example: Mikam Ja'hmka.

**Biology**

The Tajara are an omnivorous species of bipedal animals that resemble Terran felines, particularly lynxes and housecats. The size and shape of the body depend mostly on the climate. In the northern areas with more snow and colder temperature they tend to have larger paws and thicker fur, while nearer the equator they tend to have less fur and smaller paws.

Their body is almost completely covered in a thick, isolating fur, exceptions are palms of their hands and feet, their eyes and finally around their bodily orifices. Their hands are humanoid, but carry a set of claws. Their feet are feline and also have claws. Around their neck and head they normally have a mane, this mane is thicker and more wire-like.

Tajara fur colors tend to be monochrome, but they can have several colors, with the mane being darker than the rest of the fur. Tajara can have several types of patterns in their fur, ranging from stripes to spots to random color markings in their fur. This fur tends to create trouble on space stations and other hotter environments, as the tajara begin overheating slightly. 

Tajara have very large, well developed eyes set above their muzzle. Their pupils are generally large. but can contract faster than most other species. Their eyes also possess a refractive layer which greatly enhances their dark vision capabilities, this causes their eyes to shine when illuminated by weak light. 
Their teeth are long and sharp, the largest ones being the frontal corner teeth. Their teeth also grow thicker as they go further back. 
Tajara ears are long and upright, these are capable of swiveling around to locate sounds better. 

Tajara have sets of five digits per hand or foot, but they to be shorter and fatter. They have a set of retractable claws originating from a second set of knuckles. Tajara claws are always visible. The Tajara are digitigrade, this in turn forces Tajara to wear modified footwear. Due to their stubby fingers and claws they also need to wear modified gloves.

Tajara have a notably longer sleep cycle than humans, the wake period being between 36-48 hours with a subsequent sleep cycle of 20-28 hours. This pattern is often punctuated by several small naps between 5-30 minutes.

The average Tajara body is slender and highly flexible. Sexual dimorphism, except for overall size, is low between males and females. The only real exception being mammary glands, which are normally internal, but come out when the female is caring for her children. Most of their internal systems are like Terran felines, this includes their gastrological, cardiovascular and lymphatic systems. This has led many to believe that the tajara originate from somewhat the same place as Terran felines.

All medical equipment aboard NanoTrasen vessels will be compatible with Tajara biology with minimal modifications. 

**Behavior**

Tajara are a fairly superstitious species, with much of their understanding of the universe being based on there being spirits existing around the cosmos, in nearly any and all places. This has made their approach into the practical sciences slower and less refined, however they tend to find themselves excelling in fields such as anthropology, psychology, and other, less “hard” sciences.

The Tajara tend to be quite boisterous, while also having a strong, ingrained sense of duty towards projects they take on. This leads to them becoming heavily focused upon getting things done, while congruently having a sense of urgency and excitability over the topics they are handling. For this reason, Tajara tend to work well in positions where they are needed to handle large-scale projects, as they will focus themselves on said project and are liable to have an energy behind it that pushes the project to actually being finished. 

## The People of Ahdomai

### History

For hundreds of years, Ahdomai was simultaneously united and oppressed by a ruling class, referred to in the modern day by the epithet 'the Slavemasters', although in their day they went by terms that roughly translated to 'The Overseers'. The Overseers ruled with a heavy hand. Speaking when not spoken to first by an Overseer would be potentially punishable by severe beating or death. Nonetheless, their united front managed to bring an unprecedented fruition of knowledge... For the ruling class. A relatively younger civilization than humanity, under various clans of Overseers, prior to human intervention, the first world era rulers had an approximate technological basis to the late nineties, with their communications equipment on par with the late 2000s, having had ample encouragement to cement their government with unified comms. Much of the methods used by the Slavemasters are lost, as during the revolution, taking down towers and sabotaging equipment they no longer had the blueprints for was strategically key to the rebellion. Meanwhile, the average Tajaran lived on par with the early 1900s in terms of tech for the lower/middle class, with illiteracy rates incredibly high.
50 years prior to present day, a small academic exploration funded by Sol Central, unaffiliated with megacorps, discovered Ahdomai and the Tajaran. The exploration team spent five years learning the Tajaran language and culture, taking samples, with their efforts guided towards a positive reaction by the Overseers, showing them the sort of peaceful society they had attempted to cultivate, trying to have them gloss over the class disparity and poverty. Eventually, the team returned to Earth with their findings.
Soon after, multiple megacorporations took interest in Ahdomai: Much of the mineral, agricultural, and biological wealth of the planet remained untapped. "Aid" was quickly dispatched to Ahdomai in an attempt to gain the trust and cooperation of the indigenous species. Over the next ten years various megacorporations set up small laboratories and outposts to map Ahdomai out, geologically, biologically, economically.
Not long after the first laboratories had been set up, one of the intellectual revolutionaries of the oppressed majority escaped from confinement and found asylum off-planet on a NanoTrasen facility for five years. During his time in the facility, he saw how a truly collaborative effort could improve everyone's living conditions and wrote a manuscript on his ideas - "Gazing Upwards". While his original name was lost to time as he abandoned it in interests of not being targeted by Slavemasters for immediate censorship, his pen name was Harimah Ranjiira.
After his return, Ranjiira began to distribute his manuscript, and the few literate Tajaran spread it's word by mouth like wildfire - sparking revolts across the globe. The Slavemaster response was swift, uncompromising, and harsh. Soon the rebels found themselves in a full-blown war with their masters.
The megacorporations with facilities on Ahdomai, interested in maintaining their investments and seeing a chance to profit, began to provide the two factions with monetary and military aid. The rebel forces, with their superior numbers and a technological boost from their supporters, began to overtake the Slavemaster forces. However, the final blow to the Slavemaster forces was the defection of the Hadii. The Hadii, seeing the cracks in their regime, turned coat and chose to support the rebels. While several rebel clans opposed this, the Hadii support network, records, and tactical knowledge were the final push that won the war for the rebellion.
A provisional government was propped up by the various megacorporations that supported the rebels, and over time Ahdomai gained a new governmental system. Medical corporations focused around the equatorial region, while mining and production corporations focused on land near the northern and southern areas. The largest corporate influence on Ahdomai is NanoTrasen, due to their affiliation with Ranjiira, who have supported the Hadii clan - although they are by no means alone.

**Today**

After the revolution, a new government was set up, this new government being The Confederate Commonwealth of Ahdomai (Abbreviated CCA). This government lets the clan leaders deal with their own affairs, but rather deal with things such as border  disputes on Ahdomai and external affairs. The clans deal with their own mining contracts and such, but pay a certain amount of the profits to The CCA.

The Confederate Commonwealth of Ahdomai consists of three members of each of the three major ruling clans. The CCA members are selected once every two years by each of the major ruling clans.

Members of minor ruling clans may also attend CCA meetings, but only if it is specifically requested by the minor ruling clan and accepted by The CCA or if the minor ruling clan is specifically asked to attend the meeting. In these few cases, the minor ruling clan members are there to watch and only carry half a vote. 

Even as a recent addition to the galactic community, the Tajara are still seen as somewhat of a cheap workforce. With the new government more and more Tajara are becoming educated, now with a large amount of scientists and engineers and with a lack of a basic workforce on Ahdomai. 
Originally relying on other races for their technology, they have now started developing their own technology. Rural areas have become more modernized with the help of radios and networks of computers. 


### Technology

Tajaran technology, prior to the technological renaissance that occurred when they were brought into the galactic community, stood on the brink of colonizing their own star system. They had established a minor colony on their neighboring planet, S'ranjir, and had an extensive network of unmanned probes in fabrication for scanning their local system, as well as plans to send at least two on trips to scan their nearest stellar neighbor. Since meeting humanity, their technology level has been racing to catch up with the more advanced species, though they still have some time before they will be at an equal playing field. 

The Tajara have advanced remarkably far in the field of robotics. This, by itself, would be no surprise given their propensity for drone warfare and drone labor. The majority of their military strength (when it comes to an equivalent of the “grunts”) and their manual labor fronts tend to be occupied with machines rather than the Tajara. There are exceptions, of course - mining is done in conjunction with machines and their Tajaran creators, especially as they go further and further into the galaxy, having less and less space to bring their larger drones with them. Even industries such as food service are slowly being mechanized, though some pushback against this does exist - citing that the drones are unthinking, as the Tajara have yet to invent or embrace any true AI, and the common belief foods made with someone with a soul tend to be of higher quality, created with a passion that a machine cannot match. 

The machines are commonly limited to a local network, a practice that was put into place after the Overseer rebellions - it was seen, by and large, that a planetary network of their machines would simply result in another rebellious faction rising up and causing another catastrophe. 

This cultural embrace of robotics has fueled the rise of prosthetic augmentation being a part of the average Tajaran’s life. Implants, cybernetic limb replacements, and even full-body replacements are slowly but surely taking root across Ahdomai. This is especially prevalent in the larger space-port cities, as they have the largest contact with the universe at large, and the best access to greater technology. Perhaps the highest quality of these mechanical parts belong to Dyson-Rhyn’yai Cybernetics, a Human-Tajaran joint company that is dedicated to providing highly expensive, but highly effective implants, limb, and organ replacements. 

This movement towards cybernetics has caused division between different elements of Tajaran culture. The belief that one’s soul resides throughout the body has clashed with the idea of the willing replacement of appendages and, at times, the entirety of the body itself. Proponents of the practice make claim that the soul is, in all ways, something that will continue to exist and reform itself so long as the mind exists. The soul, while present throughout the form, is held together by the will of the mind, only lost when the mind itself is. Opponents hold that the soul is lost to the Aether immediately upon the destruction or loss of a part of the body, effectively being severed for the remainder of the individual’s life.

The Tajara do not currently possess some of the more advanced technologies that humanity has begun to take for granted. For instance, the Tajara lack laser-based weaponry or adequate shielding for their troops and vessels. To make up for this, the Tajara use a high quantity of ballistic weaponry and point-defense turrets for their warships, troops, and drones. The Tajara also lack cloning facilities, instead preferring to contract out human companies dedicated to the business to do necessary cloning.

Cloning itself is viewed with a somewhat more positive light, owing no small part to the organs being “natural,”  though there is still a rather divisive disagreement over whether a cloned organ or body could truly be considered to be a part of the whole, or if the soul will not be reformed with the newly grown tissue. The cloning facilities in use tend to only be found in high-density areas or in military installations, due to their high cost and the fact that they are contracted out from human medical organizations, which is a major point of non-spiritual contention for opponents of the practice. 

Most important of the technologies the Tajara lack is the Bluespace drive. While they have a gateway installed in their system (built by humanity), they lack the technology and resources necessary to manufacture their own bluespace drives. This has led them to purchasing bluespace-enabled vessels from humanity and the skrell in order to fuel their own scouting of the cosmos and defense of their system. While they are currently attempting to work with humanity to secure some plans to build a drive, negotiations have yet to proceed to a point where such a move would be agreeable for the SCG. 

### Culture

**Food**

A large portion of the Tajaran menu consists of varying types of soups and stews, made from nearly every combination of edible flora and fauna. Most of the following items do not fall in that category, which makes then notable.

Jun'Darik - Fermented fish steeped in salted wine. While the native fish of Ahdomai have yet to be exported, it has been discovered that this recipe works just fine with the alien race known as "Space Carp."

Kahal'ket Al'Kiha (Mountain Cake) - A simple cake made with Chur'eech Nuts and Berries, and baked with rendered blubber of the Elu'a Eil.

Jurl'Mah Tul'Cresh (Sweet Soup) - A very sweet broth made from fresh fat, meat, and Jurl'Mah.

Azuragh'Mah (Blue Star Or Azure Star) - Cooked Jurl'Mah syrup, moulded into a decorative shape, and studded with Chur'eech Nut flakes.

Rraasi - A popular Tajaran food, named for the one-eyed fish used in its preparation. Lightly spiced with shredded tha'draa and served cold on a heated plate. Popularized by the Inadd clan, this unusually spicy dish has become favorite of many Tajaran worldwide. Rraasi is generally within acceptable norms for the human palette, but due to it's slightly pungent nature it is considered an acquired taste.

El-A'hum - Thin cuts of the Elu'a Eil smoked with the wood and leaves of the Sanu'dra tree. The resulting flavor is not entirely dissimilar to a glazed ham. This meat is typically eaten with a side serving of Sanu'dra bark, and its portability and easy storage makes it a popular trail food.

**Language**

Siik'maas is the traditionally employed tongue on Ahdomai, and it was originally enforced by the old slavemaster regime. Though it is also spoken by humans, humans struggle with several words and pronunciations being physically impossible due to the human mouth; S turns on to sh and they would speak broken, missing out on certain words. Siik'maas is completely auditory. 

Siik'tajr is a formerly used informal pseudo sign language used by the lower class. It is partly auditory, but it is mostly spoken with tail movements, making it impossible for a human or any non-tailed creature to speak this language. It was seen as quite rude to speak this language in front of people/Tajara that didnt speak Siiktajr. 

Note that Tajara extend R sounds due to their facial anatomy.

**The Arts**

For a long period of time, the working class Tajaran were almost wholly illiterate. As such, without a proper method of recording their own history, feelings, and anything of the sort, they would often use songs and melodies to relay such ideas and concepts since they lacked the pen and paper to do so normally. Poetry and novels were a thing for the upper class. Amongst those who worked in the stoneworking industry, sculptures created out of ice and such were other ways that they could express themselves.

However, the theater played a key role for both classes of Tajaran. During times of great political or economic turmoil, seats for plays and, as technology progressed, films often sold out relatively quickly. The performances displayed contained humor, drama, or other themes that both classes could understand and find enjoyable, particularly so the working class. Unable to read prominent literary works of their time, plays based off of written scripts conveyed to them these stories in a way that did not require literacy. Often, these acts also contained musical masterpieces and tunes that would be incorporated into the cultural songs the working class favored prior to the revolution.

Because of this widespread illiteracy, written works tended to be considered things crafted specifically for the upper class to enjoy. Multiple priceless literary works were lost in the burnings of books and other written items following the political upheaval that took place during the revolution. Many Tajara resented these works. However, in recent years, it could be said that there has been a small resurgence of literary works (mostly those brought in by the humans and their corporations). However, for most of the Tajara, oral tradition remains the go-to method of passing down their history. There may even be finely-crafted clan tapestries or paintings to assist in recording the happenings of a generation.


**Religion**

Religion on Ahdomai tends to be very specific to the region that it derives from, and as such many practices can differ between any two Tajaran aboard a human vessel. That being said, there are several common points that are shared between the flavors of belief on Ahdomai.

One of the key elements of Tajaran culture is that it has very little notion of the idea of a god. While powerful spirits do exist, there are none that are creator beings or truly impervious. Tajaran belief traditionally holds that the universe simply came into being, there was no divine spark behind it nor was there any single being that directed it. Instead, the multitude of spirits that make up the Aether (the realm of spirits) were spawned from this cosmic beginning, and each began to shape reality as they saw fit, slowly turning the Universe into what there is today. 

These spirits interact with mortals on a personal level. They are very present, and very powerful, capable of directly changing the hearts and thoughts of those who are of a weaker will. To counteract this, Tajara believe, mortals must constantly be on the vigil for any spirits who may attempt to harm them, and that protective rituals must be observed on a consistent basis. 

Perhaps the second most important element of Tajaran spiritualism is the veil. These veils are worn from the age of six months on, and have been present throughout the history of the Tajara. The veils of today are much more advanced than their older counterparts, with holographic displays and the ability to switch between active modes. These veils exist to protect the souls of the Tajara, for it is believed that the windows to the soul are present in the eyes. Tajara typically only will show their eyes to very close friends, family, or loved ones. Forcefully removing the veil from a Tajara, without suitable replacement, is a very serious crime among the Tajara and carries a long sentence of imprisonment.

Magic and ritual is accepted as a fact of life among the general populace. Rituals will commonly involve acidic destruction of items offered to spirits, and runes that are used to channel and contain practical magics. The application of magic can be anything from rain-dancing rituals, to something as complex as attempting to cause hearts to stop from afar. The more intense rituals will require larger sacrifices and more of a time commitment than those that are “lesser,” with anything that would cause wounds or heal wounds taking more time. 

Most magic involves either a use of runed stones or the usage of patterns scrawled upon the ground. Runes are considered to be a much more powerful form of magic, though the process for creating them requires one to go through lengthy acidic etching into the stones. Drawn runes, such as those made upon the ground or on objects, are for “weak” magic, such as the curing of a cold or wishing for luck. These runes are much more common than the runed variant, and can be commonly seen around Tajara on human stations. 

Many Tajara will keep a small token that they, or their loved ones, have runed for good fortune and general health. These tokens can take many shapes or sizes, but they are almost universally a small item that one could keep on them easily. Giving away this token is a taken as a method of declaring one’s affection for another, and is not something to be taken lightly. Having the token stolen can lead to a Tajara being quite distressed. 

Upon death, bodies are typically burned in large basins filled with oils after death. This is done as burial is assumed to trap fragments of the soul, whereas burning will free even the weakest parts of the soul from the shattered body back into the Aether to be reborn again as a new soul. These rituals are elaborate, with family and friends coming together to revel in the rebirth of the lost Tajaran’s soul. Funerals tend to, as a result, be an odd mixture of sadness for the lost while still having joy that they will return to the world with a reborn soul.

### Clans and Families

Even today, the Tajara family is loosely based off their caste system beneath the Slavemasters.

**Hiearchy**

* Families are large, normally consisting of 5-12 individuals in the immediate family and 20-100 individuals in the extended family. Family names are shared through the paternal side of a family, and it's not uncommon for distant relatives generally share a family name. Many Tajara employed by humans prefer to use their family name second.

* Clans were tight alliances of families based primarily on occupation and location, although this definition has grown more nebulous in the modern age with the shift from a unified government to a splinter of factions. Extra-clan relationships are encouraged to foster new inter-clan alliances (and genetic spread), and clan membership for ones' immediate family is maternal. Informally to many, most clans in the modern day are considered 'sub-clans', being under alliance to one of the major factions, as described below. Many clans are directly named after the leading family of the clan, but not all families within the clan will share the same surname. As such: a Tajara with a surname of Hadii likely has a lot of political power on Ahdomai. A member of the Khayyam family, which exists within the Clan Hadii, is also worthy of respect, but will still bow to their Hadii clanmates.

* Alliances are the major power structures on Ahdomai, their boundaries set effectively marking out cultural regions. After the revolution, the primary clans that had big names within the winning faction rose to an exceptional level of providence, with many lesser clans gathering behind a primary clan. While ostensibly the major clans only hold a large portion of land, the general power attributed to them comes from their packs of locational alliance-clans that gather under their banner that comprise the major 'nations' of Ahdomai. To continue with the above example, the tajara of family Khayyam would be considered on debatably even(with variation depending on personal family status) in respect on par with a member of family Vad'ya under Clan Vad'ya, which is in alliance under the Hadii. Generally, the leading clan is considered in alliance 'over' while subclans are considered in alliance 'under', with occasional lesser clans even under those, although often the distinction blurs after a few generations, with lesser clans than under the prime being absorbed.

**Major Clans**

* The Hadii
"He will do what he can for the betterment of all Tajaran. If that means he must submit to NanoTrasen demands, then he will do so."

*History*

The largest and most organized Tajara clan on Ahdomai, the Hadii are one of the few Slavemaster clans that survived the rebellion. The Hadii survived the war betraying the other Slavemaster forces and joining the rebellion. Their treachery was the final blow that shattered the Slavemaster forces.

Since, the Hadii have remained in prominence in modern Ahdomai. Due to their centuries of leadership experience, large holdings, and extensive technical records they are considered the leading clan for most of the northern continent. After the war they have intermarried with several "Lesser" clans, and their numbers have grown noticeably.

The Hadii are directly supported by Nanotrasen, and they have been a driving force behind many of the Nanotrasen programs on Ahdomai.


*Political Stance*

The Hadii always been heavily involved in infrastructure and bureaucracy. Pushing for improvements in such is second nature to most older Hadii. Ahdomai as a whole had been ravaged by the war, and Hadii-lead expeditions have become a common sight across the northern continent, distributing texts and records to the poor and unfortunate. Many of the larger public works on Ahdomai have been funded, in part, by the Hadii.

The official clan stance on NanoTrasen is complete assimilation with the company, and Hadii leaders have been quoted stating they wish to work within human organizations to improve human views of Tajaran as second-class citizens outside of Ahdomai.

* The Kaytam

"She has seen many things in her long life, but above all she knows one thing: It is better to be dead than to remain a slave. Never Again."

*History*

Originating from the northern region, the Kaytam were one of many clans that were forced to relocate to the rockey Etari archepegalo alongside a number of exiled lower-class scientists after a failed rebellion against the regional slavemaster forces. Whilst they did succeed at killing more than a few of their masters, the rebellion ultimately failed and the bulk of the original Kaytam clan was wiped out in the resulting purges.

Many of the clans involved with the rebellion were entirely wiped out, and the remaining Kaytam were placed under the strictest, harshest conditions The Slavemasters could subject them to. For decades prominent Kaytam Tajaran were used in public demonstrations of force, a clear reminder to other clans the price of any disobedience. Across the planet the name was practically synonymous with the word criminal.

When the liberation of Ahdomai began, centuries of repressed anger flared to a head on the Erstaz regions. Almost overnight the region erupted into an angry, bloody revolt, and less than three days after the first hostilities not a single Slavemaster was left free on the Archepegalo. As the Kaytam turned their attention towards the slavemasters on the mainland, the weapons manufacturer Hosari Technologies took note and threw their support behind the southerners.

The Kaytam were a key force in the war, and gained a reputation as being extremely ruthless and blunt. Due to the high concentration of low-birth scientists, they are one of the leading technological forces on Ahdomai, especially in military applications of technology. While they share no love of how humanity treats them, as long as the Kaytam remain independent and free of slavery they are willing to honor the agreements they made during the revolution..

*Political Stance*

Every policy that the Kaytam enact focus towards a singular, concrete goal: preventing the return of The Slavemasters or any who would take their place. To that end the Kaytam will stop at nothing to remain free. While NT has shown that they do not consider Tajaran equals by any means, they have not attempted wholesale enslavement of Ahdomai and they possess the same advantage the Slavemasters had over the Tajaran initially: Technology. As long as NT has that advantage the Kaytam have stated that they will happily co-exist.

Internally the Kaytam are an unusual mix of discipline and chaos. The clan as a whole has a set of strict set of laws that every member is expected to follow, however there is no true central government on the archepegalo. Instead a loose republic of the various islands regularily meets to discuss regional policy roughly twice a year.

Militarily each island has at least one private military corporation that acts as either a police force or local militia. As crime is uniformly high across the entire region thanks Kaytam immigration policy, most of these PMC's remain at high alert year-round. More than a few PMCls are also tied with various ballistics arm's and weapon's manufacturers. Kaytam weapons are a chief export, and are well-known for quality and a unique depleted uranium slug.

* Nazkiin

"We wish for peaceful co-existence between Tajaran and Humanity, absolutely... but we cannot allow them to rule Ahdomai. We must stand on our own feet. If we do not, our culture will never regain its former glory."

**History**

Hailing from the temperate regions along the equator, the Nazkiin clan was originally a small, rag-tag group of various families that splintered away from more prominent clans during the rebellion in an attempt to get away from the fighting. After the Slavemasters were overthrown and the dust had settled, the group consolidated into their own clan, seeking to distance themselves from the conflict between the Hadii and Kaytam and instead focus on cultural recovery.

Two prominent members, Najir Nazkiin (Formerly Najir Vad'ya) and his wife Rii'aka Nazkiin (Formerly Rii'aka Chakorr), saw an opportunity to give their clan a political foothold so their endevour would be heard by the masses, by forming the Iniye-Aw'dhim (Coalition of Reclamation), a planet-wide archelogical expedition to recover artifacts, records, any scrap of pre-Slavemaster culture that might remain, in the hopes of undoing the cultural damage the Slavemaster occupation caused.

Growing by word-of-mouth and initially funded by a handful of Kaytam sub-clans, it's become the largest archelogical expedition in known Ahdomai history, attracting members from all corners, although as funding's dried up many members have had to take jobs with the various human corporations to pay for the expedition. Nonetheless, the expedition continues, and while the Nazkiin aren't political players on the level of the Hadii or Kaytam, several important cultural findings have been recovered due to the Coalition's efforts, giving the Nazkiin a degree of notability.

*Political stance*

The Nazkiin have been the main driving force behind the so-called "Co-existence" movement. Where the Isolationist movement pushes for NanoTrasen to leave Ahdomai completely, the goal of the Co-existence movement is for Ahdomai and NanoTrasen to exist as close allies, but nontheless independent factions. They see the Hadii as too greedy, too eager to let NanoTrasen take control of Ahdomai, and not concerned enough with restoring the Tajaran culture to its pre-Slavemaster glory. Nazkiin's main policy is said cultural growth, to which end they formed the Iniye-Aw'dhim, which has become the largest, most widespread expedition of its kind, to find what records and artifacts the Hadii did not archive and the Slavemasters did not destroy.

Their stance has caused some friction with the Hadii, especially the more extreme Hadii sects who see any kind of anti-NT policy as a threat to Ahdomai. Despite the opposition, or in some cases because of it, the Co-existence movement has garnered a sizable following, and the Nazkiin's status as the creators and overseers of the Iniye-Aw'dhim has given them a solid political foothold for their stance to be heard.

**Minor Clans**

* Hadhim Clan

A smaller clan, settled in the northern areas of Ahdomai just above the contested zone. The Hadhim clan hold the virtues of Family and Culture, because of this they are often known as being great Traders, Doctors and Historians.

Since the days before the arrival of the megacorporations, rumours have surfaced in regards to the clan, due to the way family members within the clan treat each other, it is often thought that people of the Hadhim clan are prone to incestuous relations among their family.


*Formation*

Long ago, a Hadii known as Nala Hadii, frustrated with her low ranking within her own clan and therefore limited political pull, decided that instead of dealing with the long process of groveling and politicking she would instead form her own. With that, she took what she had and anyone who would follow and went to the northlands, into an area that was previously unclaimed and formed her own clan, which came to be known as Hadhim.

Over the years, the Hadhim clan grew larger and larger due to skills presented by a good number of them as skilled traders, while other members worked as doctors, using their knowledge in local herbs and remedies to heal travellers, for a price.

*The Fall*

Due to their close proximity with barbarian lands, the Hadhim clan had many dealings with their more savage kin. Despite this, for a good portion of time the clan had never experienced problems with the tribes they dealt with aside from the occassional incident which arose naturally due to their differences in culture.

It wasn't until another tribe led by Raah Zhan-Khazan showed up for this peace to falter. Raah had noticed that the Hadhim clan freely traded with little fear with other raider tribes, and thus they seemed to let their guard down around the raiders.

With this in mind, Raah began a number of raids, stealing plenty of the Hadhim supplies and killing many, with even more dying off during the harsh winters due to now inadequate stocks.

Because of this, the clan numbers dwindled significantly and eventually fell to a dangerously low number, it has only been in the modern day in which their numbers seem to be returning to even a fraction of their former glory.

*Families*

Within the Hadhim clan there are three families, the most prominent being what the clan is named after.

* Hadhim Family

Making up 75% of the clan, The Hadhim family is proud, holding on dearly to their heritage and hoping that some day their glory will be regained. Older members of the Hadhim family likely having higher standards of living and therefore scoff when things are less then ideal, where as younger generations are more used to the standard of living they have now and while they still strive to attain the former glory of the clan, they realize they can be happy with what they have.

Typical features of someone from the Hadhim family are a thin build, green eyes and a light cream coloured fur.

* Ramirh Family

Much smaller then the Hadhim Family, making up only 15% of the clan, the Ramirh are the faithful companions and servants of the Hadhim family. One may think they would be bitter about this position, however, most of the Ramirh seem fairly happy with it. Some say that the skills with medicines and herbs originated with the Ramirh family and were passed on to the other two families.

Typical features of someone from the Ramirh family are a somewhat stout build, dark blue eyes and light brown fur.

* Hrash'im Family

The smallest of the three families at only 10% of the clan, Hrash'im are considered the enforcers of the clan and as such, took the biggest hit during the barbarian raids. While they still protect the clan's lands to the best of their ability, the Hrash'im seem almost resentful as they feel they aren't adequetly represented.

Typical features of someone from the Hrash'im family are a bulky, muscular build, yellow eyes and grey fur.
