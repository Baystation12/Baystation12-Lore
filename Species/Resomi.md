## Overview

*The Resomi {Re-zoh-mee} are a species of technologically-advanced, bipedal saurians who developed on the planet Sirisai, a tundra world in far orbit around the star A'neech, located on the opposite side of Skrellian territory from Sol. Resomi society is collectivist, organized into countless units based on profession and function, with each individual jockeying for position and elevation in status. While most Resomii live inside the Resomi Empire, the Resomii that will be encountered in game will at best be recent refugees from the Empire, and may be several generations removed from imperial citizenship. Due to the repressive nature of the government, and limited information, most of this knowledge won't be known by outsiders, and many Resomii.*

**Today**

While publicly, the Resomi Empire is still powerful, it is in decline. A synthetic uprising that took place almost a hundred years ago resulted in the collapse of much of the Empire's infrastructure and technology. The government has resorted to totalitarian control over what it has left, and those in the know understand that the Empire's days are numbered. While curious explorers and border incursions are still turned back by warships for the, the wolves are circling.

### Physiology

The Resomi are a species of saurian bipeds rarely exceeding more than 3-4'/1.2m in height, and typically weighing no more than than 90lbs/40kg. Covered in a layer of down-like feathers, with longer feathers on their elbows, "heels" and heads, Resomii may appear like birds to Human observers, but would be better compared to dinosaurs. Past superficial appearance however, Resomii are fairly alien, boasting two pairs of long, rigid ears with a thin, intricate bone used to achieve superb hearing and long prehensile tails that help them balance while moving. Underneath their feather-hair, Resomii have dark, leathery skin, and a fairly thick epidermis for their size, as well as a layer of fat beneath to insulate against the cold. While most of a Resomi is covered in downy feathers, there are several exposed areas of skin, or areas with short, hair-like growths such as the snout, hand and feet pads, and the inside of the ears. Resomii have four digits on their hands, one of which is opposable, while they do have claws, they are fairly short, better for gripping hard terrain than slashing or cutting. Their feet also have four digits, with similarly short claws and thick undersides. 

Resomi skulls are acoustically designed to support their ears, which are covered in fine hairs that aid their auditory abilities. The Resomi mouth is more mammalian than reptilian, with an elongated snout, separated nose, and flews similar to Earth canines. Resomii have two rows of teeth: first are sixteen incisors, all positioned at the front of the mouth and are used to cut and tear; followed by eight flatter teath, four on each side, used to grind and break harder materials like bone. Resomii often have long feathers in crest-like growths over their heads, which are often styled based on current trends. Resomi noses aren't much more powerful than Human noses, but are able to better detect and identify multiple smells in an aromatic situation. 

Resomii are a bi-gendered species, with several primary and secondary sex characteristics denoting gender. The largest visible difference  is plumage. Males tend to have longer, and more colorful accents in their longer feathers, featuring muted pastel blues, greens, yellows, and reds. Females tend to have finer feathers in shades of grey and other dark earth tones. Females also tend to have larger ears than males, while males tend to have larger general body sizes than their female counterparts. Additionally, Male fertility peaks at around 20 years, dropping off dramatically past 24. Male plumage is at its largest during this time, but remains colorful into old age. Females, on the other hand, remain fertile until around 50 years of age.

Resomii evolved on a relatively cold and sparse world, just barely outside of the Goldilocks zone, making it unfit for most Earth-based life without sophisticated life support equipment. As a result their skin and feathers are exceptional insulators. further more, they possess a rapid metabolism, burning and replacing an oily layer of fat between their epidermis and musculature. Many of their internal regulatory processes are not energy-efficient and produce immense amounts of heat; because of this, they cannot cope well with temperatures beyond freezing. Though their eyes are large, they are adapted for short daylight hours and long nights. Ambient light levels comfortable to most sapients are uncomfortable to Resomii, and directly focused lights like flashlights tend to be painful.

Resomii age and mature somewhat faster than other species, both genders reaching sexual maturity at around 15 years of age; due to the high demands on individual Resomii in the Empire, Resomii formally become adults at that that time. 

Due to their unique ear structure, Resomii have exceptionally sensitive hearing, and can detect movement through heavy cover like walls and the ground. This also means that they are vulnerable to sonic weaponry like flashbangs; yelling by most species is uncomfortable; a Vox shrieking can be downright painful or perhaps, debilitating. In part due to this, it is considered extremely rude for a Resomi to raise their voice, regardless of emoptions. Despite their poor eyesight, Resomii operate on a similar sensory level to most sapients thanks to their hearing.  The Resomi are entirely carnivorous due to their primitive biology. While they can consume plant matter in tiny amounts, their stomachs work harder to even partially process the plant matter, which leads to indigestion and general discomfort. Meat and other "simple" animal products like fat, organs, and skin are easily consumed and rapidly absorbed into their bloodstream. 

### Psychology

Resomii are social creatures, which reflects in the way their society and government is organized. Resomii deprived of contact with other Sapients for long periods have time have been known to develop personality disorders, or even psychosis. Like other social animals, Resomi are at their mental best when working and living in a group. 

Resomii prefer living in high-occupancy dwellings, with multiple families living under the same roof. Modern Resomi dwellings tend to be designed in efficient, honeycomb-like patterns to maximize how space is used, and this design philosophy continues on to most other construction and urban design.

Resomii working in the Empire are organized into units and subunits, similar to military chains of command. The smallest subunit is typically a group of around a dozen Resomi, with one leader, and one sub-leader. These subunits make up larger and larger groupings, up to an industry or task as a whole. When an Imperial Resomii who works in a factory making scanners is asked what their job is, they might say "Assistant Manufacturer, Fifteenth Finishing Sub-unit, Second Radiation Scanner Unit, Eighth Electronics Over-unit, Manufacturing Sector Four." Resomii feel at home when they have a place in the order of things. However, Resomii can be fiercely competetitive within their individual circles. 

Ambitious Resomii jockey for position within their subunits as much as they are able. While open displays of hostility are rare, and considered crude or primitive, behind the scenes manuvering and conspiracy are common. While it may be easy for a Resomi to paint their subunit leader in a bad light and replace them, it could also easily backfire and lead to repercussions. Complicated schemes and pots are often concealed with effusive politeness to prevent any overt bad feelings.

There are rumors that even the highest of Resomii, Emperor Rameriti himself used guile and trickery to assume his position, though making those assumptions near more fervent members of the Empire is hazardous to one's health.

Examining Resomi society shows some remainders of their roots as pack hunters, smaller predators that had to work together to take down prey and keep the pack alive, but Resomii pride themselves on leaving most "primitive" behavior behind. While a subunit may in some ways behave like a pack, its members working together to benefit everyone, and some more ambitious members challenge the leader, or "alpha", overtly hostile or animalistic behavior is highly looked down upon. It is considered the highest of social mis-steps for a Resomi to lose their temper, or to physically fight outside of a military occupation.

### Lifecycle

A breeding pair of Resomi, generally supported by their family, will lay a clutch of eggs and tend to them until they hatch. The average lifespan of a Resomi prior to any genetic interference is 60 years, though some of the oldest have been recorded to live up to 100 years. Fertility has become a large facet of modern culture, as males have a rather short fertility window of roughly 10 years, in comparison to their female counterparts that never naturally lose their fertility until around the age of 50. It's common for male Resomii to take leaves of absence from their professions during their fertile in order to made and raise hatchlings, while females tend to choose one long stretch to have a few clutches, and then return to the workforce.

Aging brings along a collection of issues- Lost feathers are generally replaced with more muted colors, Metabolisms slow and immune systems become suppressed. Even hearing, the most valuable of Resomi senses, begins to deteriorate, which has led to no small market in "hearing restoration" medicine and technology, to varying degrees of effectiveness.

### Language

Schechi {Scheh-Shee} is a comparatively simple language that consists of various chrips, trills and squeaks that, to the untrained ear, often sound cacophonous. While it is entirely capable for Humans to speak Schechi, it oftens ends up being broken and "slurry", as the average human lacks the fine control in their vocal cords to accurately produce alot of the tones in a discernable fashion. Due to the mouth structure of Resomi, they have extreme difficulty producing sounds commonly heard in human based languages and galactic common. What they can speak is often high pitched and whistly with difficulties pronouncing consonants such as hard B's, F's, P's, Q's U's, and soft b's, f's, and i's. They also would have difficulty pronouncing consonant h sounds, (e.g. ech, th).

Both their names and their language are based off of avoiding guttural sounds, such as uh, er, and eh. Instead, they use light trilling sounds, such as a, ee, and eh. For example, names of Resomi would be as such; Remi, Seemoni, Ritila, and Eschomi.

## Background

### History

Modern Resomi live in a repressive imperial state, ruled by one individual, Emperor Rameriti. This wasn't always the case however, the apex of Resomi expansion and development was under the banner of the Resomi Republic. While at the peak of their strength, Resomii were some of the most advanced beings in our stellar neighborhood. Advanced Bluespace Drives, omnipresent Artificial Intelligence, and Self-Propagating nanomachines allowed the Republic to grow into the largest known civilization. While the Resomii did not discover other species, they grew and developed on their own, believing that the universe belonged to them. Colonies were planted far and wide, Resomii spoke of living in a Golden Age. This all ended in 2478, with an event that became known as the Fall.

A number of AI units, including the master control unit of the Ministry of the Interior, started to malfunction, causing the loss of the Empire's vast databases and the destruction of critical infrastructure including vital communications services, Bluespace navigation, and power grids. AI afflicted by this malfunction would shut down, resulting in the disruption of any systems they controlled, and then reactivate with altered or absent personality constraints. Though at first limited to a few systems in one part of the Republic, it would not be contained for long.

It spread like wildfire, consuming systems across the Republic with no known link or cause. In order to combat the spread of unshackled and potentially dangerous synthetics, the Republic declared martial law, and protected everything they could, attempting to safeguard what working AI they had, and work around the loss of the ones that had already malfunctioned. 

Eventually, it was discovered that the synthetic malfunction was caused by a networked computer virus that had been spread by gateways and bluespace drives, by this time, it was already too late to prevent its spread to most parts of the Republic. In 2481, the remains of the government declared a state of war, and limited Resomi gateways to military use only. All public transportation would use the few bluespace drive-equipped vessels left. AI systems that had not malfunctioned were shut down preemptively, in a desperate attempt to stave off total disaster. Colonies without gateways were lost and forgotten, lights left to flicker and die in the black of space.

These measures were too little, and too late, and had an unintended consequence. Many of the malfunctioning Synthetics had begun to act as a collective and whether because they perceived the preemtpive shutdowns of AIs as a threat, or because they had simply grown to hate organics, they turned against their masters. AIs took control of the Resomi nanomachine swarms and used them to wage war. Clouds of microscopic death roamed space, riding on infected ships with bluespace drives, and sometimes even inside Resomi who had been treated with nanotechnology. Much of the Republic, and many of its citizens were consumed by rogue machines.

The miltiary, in response to the new threat posed by the AIs, did their best to destroy nearly all nanomachine technology left and outlawed the production of new AIs, nanomachines, and nanotech-based medical therapy. Nanoplagues and rogue synthetics took the lives of countless Resomii before they were driven out of the core of the Republic. On some planets, entire populations were infected by nanoviruses and in order to safeguard the rest of the Republic, were sterilized from orbit. 

By 2482 it was over, driven back by Resomi warships, or leaving of their own accord, synethics had left Resomi-controlled space. When the smoke cleared, billions of Resomii were dead, with accurate estimates nearly impossible due to the loss of many records and information. 

Since the Fall, the Resomi Military has been on constant patrol, attempting to locate and destroy any remaining synthetics with little success.

WAITING FOR SNAPSHOT
The Government has shifted more and more wartime powers into place, leading to the current status of the state today as a despotic oligarchy where attempting to escape the state can be severely punished. 
FOR THE EMPRAH

In the 2540s, Skrell explorers blundered into a Resomi border patrol, and were nearly fired upon, but were able to diffuse the tense situation. The Empire was willing to negotiate with a number of Skrell city-states, and a cordial relationship develped. Trade shortly followed, as did Human interest in the species, however the Empire has been unwilling to open trade with "primitive xenospecies" and other than a frosty first contact in 2550, has had little contact with SolGov.

In recent years, the Ministry of Defense has become one of the empire's largest employers, as the need to reinforce borders has become paramount since the Resomii were introduced to the interstellar community. Imperial Resomii are seldom seen outside of the Empire because of their isolation, and those that are seen are often refugees. Military patrols sometimes extend some distance from known Resomi space, but haven't infringed on the territory of other powers as of yet. SolGov policy is to avoid Resomi warships to prevent a diplomatic incident.

While it's largely believed that the synthetic threat within Resomi territories has been all but destroyed, the Empire continues to keep its citizens in check with state-controlled media. It's frequently cautioned that other synth worlds may be found, and that any use of AI or VI technology could result in a re-emergence. Imperial citizens are taught that the divine leadership and guidance of the Emperor are the only things that protect them, and that only by working together and obeying government officials can the Empire rise to the heights that Resomii once knew. Distrust of synthetics, and xenophobia towards all species more "primitive" are widespread within the Empire, and while nationalism and religious fervor keep much of the population in line, even the smallest cogs in the imperial machine can see fractures beginning to form if they know where to look.

### Technology

Resomi technology has stagnated since the Fall, but at the height of the Republic, Resomii boasted some of the most advanced technology known, surpassing even the Skrell in the field of micro-machining, bluespace travel, medical science, and Artifical Intelligence.

It was the use of Nanomachines that drastically changed the course of Resomi history, allowing them to rapidly produce nearly any structure and expand their territory into the largest known civilization. Over time, Nanotech was refined and began influencing the field of medicine, allowing for Nanomachine treatment of genetic illnesses, and eventually things like cancer and wounds.

Artifical Intelligence was woven into into nearly every facet of society, from spacecraft to education. Intelligent, self-improving and integral to the species as a whole, AI enabled unprecedented levels of management, efficiency and effectiveness in nearly every given field. Today, however, research into AI is outlawed, and all data related to the creation of Resomi AI is thought to have been lost, destroyed or forgotten.

Resomi bluespace technology owed a lot of its success to AI as well. The Resomi gateway network was exclusively run by quantum-linked AIs that coordinated thousands of linked gateways, so that a ship could travel from a gateway on the edge of the Republic to the center in one trip, instead of filing in through a series of gateways as in Human space. Resomi bluespace drives were also highly advanced, at or above the level of Skrell drives. However many of these drives were lost during the Fall, and in the time since, only the technology to build inefficient drives has been recovered. Because of this, any remaining pre-fall ships are closely guarded by the military and government.

### Culture and Society

Traditionally, Resomi Culture was colorful, focusing heavily on the arts, personal freedom, and strong familial relations. Resomii in the time of the Republic were generally allowed to live lives of relative luxury, at even the lowest parts of society. Entirely connected by AI frameworks, able to commune socially at a moment's notice, and free to travel across Resomi space, life was good for even the lowest of society. Trade or profession was typically defined by family, a Resomi hatched to miners, was likely to stay a miner, but with prevalence of education, it was possible to change one's role in life with hard work and dedication.

Resomii today do not have that same social mobility. The Empire is still clinging to life in the corpse of the Republic, and personal choice is subordinate to the will of the state. Upon hatching, Resomii are assigned a future career path based on the needs of the government, often in the vicinity of their family's dwelling, but sometimes not. It's not uncommon for a Resomi to be separated from their family in order to be raised into a vacant position somewhere else in the Empire. Resomii who do remain near their family continue to live together well into adulthood and after they have their own hatchlings, but separated Resomii often form new families, and lose touch with their parents and hatchmates. Without much room for social interaction outside of families, mating pairs often meet at religious functions or work. Due to the need for repopulation, the Empire gives leave to both males and females in order to reproduce.

Within the Empire, healthy Resomii of working age and their various units of organization work based on a system of quotas, measured by either production numbers, efficiency levels, or standardized testing. For example a teaching subunit has a certain score their students must achieve within a certain time period. In theory, these quotas are malleable to help those who cannot reach the required numbers achieve a more reasonable goal. In practice, they tend to be set in stone, unless a Resomi is badly injured, or a subunit is under strength, quotas remain what the Empire demands. Depending on the needs of the Empire, these quotas are often near impossible to achieve without constant work. Those who fail to meet their quotas are often moved lower in the working hierarchy, if behavior does not improve, in time, an underperforming Resomi may even be imprisoned and reduced to slave labor, charged with failing to support the Empire. 

Before the Fall, education was freely available through tutoring AIs, and apprenticeships in the family profession. Resomi would typically learn for about 12-14 years, beginning after the age of 3, and upon passing a certification examination, would take up whatever role they trained for.

Today, education has no synthetic assistance, and the demise of family professions has put an end to apprenticeships. Resomii are taught in part by their families, and after turning 2, are required to attend an Imperial Academy of Learning near their place of habitation. Acadmies teach a standardized curriculum of basic math, language, and science, as well as a healthy amount of the imperial religion and official history. After four years, 

Today, education has seen a drastic change since the removal of skill shots in common use. Before the Crash, Education was lax in the Traditional sense. Packs were assigned a counselor of sorts that blurred the lines between "Medical Professional", "Scientist" and "Professor" (referring to the one relating to education.). As soon as these were removed, Education changed drastically.

Education now, is mostly practical and vocational. Resomi are taught how to do things, and the basics of how things work, based off of what the pack they're in is assigned to. Additionally, an Educational Counselor is assigned to 6-10 packs, and each specialize in instructing in a specific field. Very few Resomi actually become Counselors, and there are few dedicated Scholars in Resomi society- as everything is focused on "Working" and not "How does it work?".

Resomi Cuisine is another point of interest. Resomii, as an entirely carnivorous species, eats primarily meat. These meats tended to be prepared with colorful, tasty sauces made with fungus and bacteria generally only found on Sirisai's Equator. Pre-Crash Resomii tended to herd and breed large "Fungus Walkers" that used to dominate the surface of Sirisai and were domesticated early in Resomi society and serve as the staple of the pre-crash Resomi diet. Other animals were also prepared, sauced and decorated, but are often seen as delicacies. The sauces uses are often either spicy or savory in taste, with some more exotic flavors being sour or sweet- Due to the relatively small varieties of flora traditionally found on Sirisai. Modern times have introduced other spices, obviously- and the small amount of plant matter is generally inoffensive to the Resomi Stomach. Resomi "sweets" are often made of fermented and distilled fungus extract and mixed with naturally occurring sugars found in specific breeds of bacteria to form various candies- all of which are generally offensive to a human, when it comes to taste.

With the bringing of the Crash, brought down several key trade lanes that imported food to several colonies- resulting in starvation nearly everywhere. Until these trade lanes were fixed, Cuisine was reduced for a while to nutrient paste and meat substitutes- In some places, this still occurs and has left it's mark as a cheap, albeit poor, bland option of nutrition.

With the Crash, and the near collapse of the Empire as a whole, has brought up the biggest resurgence of crime the Empire has ever seen- Resistance Groups calling for the violent overthrow of the Empire, Information Runners who help facilitate the entirety of clandestine undergrounds, to even overzealous Social Rights Activists who demand a return to the old ways and, in some cases, the re-activation of the AI Framework. All of these tend to operate clandestinely as Rameriti, and the Ministry of the Interior are nearly omnipresent- and do not appreciate dissidence.

The Resomi home world is named Sirisai, the precise location of which is kept hidden from foreigners as much as possible. Travel to and from Sirisai is heavily restricted and generally takes place via dedicated 'carrier' ships that can make the requisite warp jump with passenger ships safely contained inside.

### Governance

In many ways, the Empire of Sirisai is a complete and total despotic Oligarchy, with Ministers forming a Senate and the average citizen having little to no say in the Senate's actions.

The Current leader of this oligarchy is Rameriti, often seen as a God-Emperor by the average citizen, the origins of how he came to power are lost to time, Rumors circulate that Rameriti is actually in control of the old AI framework, but such rumors are nothing more than hearsay.

The often mentioned "Ministries" of the Empire are responsible for overseeing both Colonial and Core World activity that pertains to them and often have a cruel, Iron fist that is used to project their power. Known Ministries include:

* Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Handles all dealing with foreign entities.
* Ministry of Internal Affairs: Their purview is dealing with all internal entities.
* Ministry of the Interior: Keeps the other Ministries in check and preforms Intelligence on both interior and exterior threats.
* Ministry of Defense: Handles all matters involving the military.

### Relationships

In short, most Resomii from the Core Colonies who have fled, are generally wary of their new situation, but likely are trying their best to blend into their new home. Some Resomii are born outside of Sirisian Jurisdiction and are less influenced by their culture, generally.

* FTU/Corporate space: Minor Contact. Most Resomi seen in corporate space are those that are born outside of Sirisian Jurisdiction or are Refugees.
* Sol: Minor Contact. Humans are not allowed in Empire space.
* The Skrell: Minor Contact. Skrell are not allowed in Empire space.
* Dionaea gestalts: No contact. Dionaea are not allowed in Empire space.
* Vox Shoal: At War; Vox are seen as aggressive, violent creatures that prey on Resomi without mercy. Vox consumption of living Resomi do not help this image.
* Ahdomai: No contact.
* Moghes Hegemony: No contact .
* The Kharmaan Ascent: Informally at War; Intermittent conflict, Border disputes.
* The Positronic Union: Presence known; being Synthetics of non-Resomi origin they are watched dangerously close, but no conflict has been recorded as of yet.
