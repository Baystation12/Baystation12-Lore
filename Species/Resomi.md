## Overview

*The Resomi {Re-zoh-mee} are a species of technologically-advanced, bipedal saurians who developed on the planet Sirisai, a tundra world in far orbit around the star A'neech, located on the opposite side of Skrellian territory from Sol. Resomi society is collectivist, organized into countless units based on profession and function, with each individual jockeying for position and elevation in status. While most Resomii live inside the Resomi Empire, the Resomii that will be encountered in game will at best be recent refugees from the Empire, and may be several generations removed from imperial citizenship. Due to the repressive nature of the government, and limited information, most of this knowledge won't be known by outsiders, and many Resomii.*

**Today**

While publicly, the Resomi Empire is still powerful, it is in decline. A synthetic uprising that took place almost a hundred years ago resulted in the collapse of much of the Empire's infrastructure and technology. The government has resorted to totalitarian control over what it has left, and those in the know understand that the Empire's days are numbered. While curious explorers and border incursions are still turned back by warships for the, the wolves are circling.

### Physiology

The Resomi are a species of saurian bipeds rarely exceeding more than 3-4'/1.2m in height, and typically weighing no more than than 90lbs/40kg. Covered in a layer of down-like feathers, with longer feathers on their elbows, "heels" and heads, Resomii may appear like birds to Human observers, but would be better compared to dinosaurs. Past superficial appearance however, Resomii are fairly alien, boasting two pairs of long, rigid ears with a thin, intricate bone used to achieve superb hearing and long prehensile tails that help them balance while moving. Underneath their feather-hair, Resomii have dark, leathery skin, and a fairly thick epidermis for their size, as well as a layer of fat beneath to insulate against the cold. While most of a Resomi is covered in downy feathers, there are several exposed areas of skin, or areas with short, hair-like growths such as the snout, hand and feet pads, and the inside of the ears. Resomii have four digits on their hands, one of which is opposable, while they do have claws, they are fairly short, better for gripping hard terrain than slashing or cutting. Their feet also have four digits, with similarly short claws and thick undersides. 

Resomi skulls are acoustically designed to support their ears, which are covered in fine hairs that aid their auditory abilities. The Resomi mouth is more mammalian than reptilian, with an elongated snout, separated nose, and flews similar to Earth canines. Resomii have two rows of teeth: first are sixteen incisors, all positioned at the front of the mouth and are used to cut and tear; followed by eight flatter teath, four on each side, used to grind and break harder materials like bone. Resomii often have long feathers in crest-like growths over their heads, which are often styled based on current trends. Resomi noses aren't much more powerful than Human noses, but are able to better detect and identify multiple smells in an aromatic situation. 

Resomii are a bi-gendered species, with several primary and secondary sex characteristics denoting gender. The largest visible difference  is plumage. Males tend to have longer, and more colorful accents in their longer feathers, featuring muted pastel blues, greens, yellows, and reds. Females tend to have finer feathers in shades of grey and other dark earth tones. Females also tend to have larger ears than males, while males tend to have larger general body sizes than their female counterparts. Additionally, Male fertility peaks at around 20 years, dropping off dramatically past 24. Male plumage is at its largest during this time, but remains colorful into old age. Females, on the other hand, remain fertile until around 50 years of age.

Resomii evolved on a relatively cold and sparse world, just barely outside of the Goldilocks zone, making it unfit for most Earth-based life without sophisticated life support equipment. As a result their skin and feathers are exceptional insulators. further more, they possess a rapid metabolism, burning and replacing an oily layer of fat between their epidermis and musculature. Many of their internal regulatory processes are not energy-efficient and produce immense amounts of heat; because of this, they cannot cope well with temperatures beyond freezing. Though their eyes are large, they are adapted for short daylight hours and long nights. Ambient light levels comfortable to most sapients are uncomfortable to Resomii, and directly focused lights like flashlights tend to be painful.

Resomii age and mature somewhat faster than other species, both genders reaching sexual maturity at around 15 years of age; due to the high demands on individual Resomii in the Empire, Resomii formally become adults at that that time. 

Due to their unique ear structure, Resomii have exceptionally sensitive hearing, and can detect movement through heavy cover like walls and the ground. This also means that they are vulnerable to sonic weaponry like flashbangs; yelling by most species is uncomfortable; a Vox shrieking can be downright painful or perhaps, debilitating. In part due to this, it is considered extremely rude for a Resomi to raise their voice, regardless of emoptions. Despite their poor eyesight, Resomii operate on a similar sensory level to most sapients thanks to their hearing.  The Resomi are entirely carnivorous due to their primitive biology. While they can consume plant matter in tiny amounts, their stomachs work harder to even partially process the plant matter, which leads to indigestion and general discomfort. Meat and other "simple" animal products like fat, organs, and skin are easily consumed and rapidly absorbed into their bloodstream. 

### Psychology

Resomii are social creatures, which reflects in the way their society and government is organized. Resomii deprived of contact with other Sapients for long periods have time have been known to develop personality disorders, or even psychosis. Like other social animals, Resomi are at their mental best when working and living in a group. 

Resomii prefer living in high-occupancy dwellings, with multiple families living under the same roof. Modern Resomi dwellings tend to be designed in efficient, honeycomb-like patterns to maximize how space is used, and this design philosophy continues on to most other construction and urban design.

Resomii working in the Empire are organized into units and subunits, similar to military chains of command. The smallest subunit is typically a group of around a dozen Resomi, with one leader, and one sub-leader. These subunits make up larger and larger groupings, up to an industry or task as a whole. When an Imperial Resomii who works in a factory making scanners, is asked what their job is, they might say "Assistant Manufacturer, Fifteenth Finishing Sub-unit, Second Radiation Scanner Unit, Eight Electronics Over-unit, Manufacturing Sector." Resomii feel at home when they have a place in the order of things. However, Resomii can be fiercely competetitive within their individual circles. 

Ambitious Resomii jockey for position within their subunits as much as they are able. While open displays of hostility are rare, and considered crude or primitive, behind the scenes manuvering and conspiracy are common. While it may be easy for a Resomi to paint their subunit leader in a bad light and replace them, it could also easily backfire and lead to repercussions. Complicated schemes and pots are often concealed with effusive politeness to prevent any overt bad feelings.

There are rumors that even the highest of Resomii, Emperor Rameriti himself used guile and trickery to assume his position, though making those assumptions near more fervent members of the Empire is hazardous to one's health.

Examining Resomi society shows some remainders of their roots as pack hunters, smaller predators that had to work together to take down prey and keep the pack alive, but Resomii pride themselves on leaving most "primitive" behavior behind. While a subunit may in some ways behave like a pack, its members working together to benefit everyone, and some more ambitious members challenge the leader, or "alpha", overtly hostile or animalistic behavior is highly looked down upon. It is considered the highest of social mis-steps for a Resomi to lose their temper, or to physically fight outside of a military occupation.

### Lifecycle

A breeding pair of Resomi, generally supported by their social grouping/pack, will lay a clutch of eggs and tend to them until they hatch. The average lifespan of a Resomi prior to any genetic interference is 60 years, though some of the oldest have been recorded to live up to 100 years. Fertility has become a large facet of modern culture, as males have a rather short fertility window of roughly 10 years, in comparison to their female counterparts that never naturally lose their fertility until around the age of 50. It's common for male Resomii to take leaves of absence from their professions during their fertile in order to made and raise hatchlings, while females tend to choose one long stretch to have a few clutches, and then return to the workforce.

Aging brings along a collection of issues- Lost feathers are generally replaced with more muted colors, Metabolisms slow and immune systems become suppressed. Even hearing, the most valuable of Resomi senses, begins to deteriorate, which has led to no small market in "hearing restoration" medicine and technology, to varying degrees of effectiveness.

### Language

Schechi {Scheh-Shee} is a comparatively simple language that consists of various chrips, trills and squeaks that, to the untrained ear, often sound cacophonous. While it is entirely capable for Humans to speak Schechi, it oftens ends up being broken and "slurry", as the average human lacks the fine control in their vocal cords to accurately produce alot of the tones in a discernable fashion. Due to the mouth structure of Resomi, they have extreme difficulty producing sounds commonly heard in human based languages and galactic common. What they can speak is often high pitched and whistly with difficulties pronouncing consonants such as hard B's, F's, P's, Q's U's, and soft b's, f's, and i's. They also would have difficulty pronouncing consonant h sounds, (e.g. ech, th).

Both their names and their language are based off of avoiding guttural sounds, such as uh, er, and eh. Instead, they use light trilling sounds, such as a, ee, and eh. For example, names of Resomi would be as such; Remi, Seemoni, Ritila, and Eschomi.

## Background

### History

Modern Resomi live in a repressive imperial state, ruled by one individual, Emperor Rameriti. This wasn't always the case however, the apex of Resomi expansion and development was under the banner of the Resomi Republic. While at the peak of their strength, Resomii were some of the most advanced beings in our stellar neighborhood. Advanced Bluespace Drives, omnipresent Artificial Intelligence, and Self-Propagating nanomachines allowed the Republic to grow into the largest known civilization. While the Resomii did not discover other species, they grew and developed on their own, believing that the universe belonged to them. Colonies were planted far and wide, Resomii spoke of living in a Golden Age. This all ended in 2478.

A number of AI units, including the master control unit of the Ministry of the Interior, started to malfunction, causing the loss of the Empire's vast databases and the destruction of critical infrastructure including vital communications services, Bluespace navigation, and power grids.

Initially the cause of the malfunction was not known, but it seemed to spread rapidly and effect AI systems all across Resomi space. In order to combat the spread of unshackled and potentially dangerous synthetics, the Republic declared martial law, and shut down their gateway network. Military forces protected everything they could. Colonies without gateways were lost and forgotten, deleted from records and libraries.

Eventually, it was discovered that the synthetic malfunction was caused by a networked computer virus that had propagated its way through the Resomi empire's interstellar network. In 2481, in order to help prevent the continued spread of the virus, the government initiated wartime declarations which mandated the shutdown of all major gate networks through Resomi space to public use and required all transportation to be through government sanctioned transport vessels that are kept disconnected from all external networks. In order to continue to propagate.

Within a few months, however, the threat of the rogue synthetics rose to a new height when it was revealed that some of the synths had begun to act as a collective and perceived the Resomi empire as a threat. The synths had developed a system to take control of nanomachine swarms that were frequently used in Resomi space and began to turn them on their creators, leading to what is believed to be the only case of Nano plague in the galaxy. Nanomachines frequently found in the skill shots that were used by Resomi began to damage and consume their hosts from the inside in order to reproduce and spread.

In response to the new inorganic threat posed by the Nano plague, the Resomi government began to institute more policy to fight back, leading to the destruction of nearly all nanomachine technology and the outlawing of skill shots and swarm based medical therapy. The Nano Plague resulted in the death of countless numbers of Resomi. On some planets, the entire population became infected and in order to safeguard the rest of the empire, would have to be electromagnetically sterilized to remove traces of the plague.

Since 2481, the Resomi Military has been on constant patrol, attempting to locate synthetic controlled locations and destroying them. The Government has shifted more and more wartime powers into place, leading to the current status of the state today as a despotic oligarchy where attempting to escape the state can be severely punished. The Ministry of Defense has become one of the empire's largest employers as the need to reinforce borders seems to become necessary more and more as Resomi make contact with foreign species. Resomi are seldom seen outside of the empire because of their isolation, and those that are seen are likely those that managed to slip through cracks in the empire's controlled borders.

While it's largely believed that the Synthetic threat within its territories has been all but destroyed, the Empire continues to keep its citizens in check with state-controlled media. It's frequently reported that other synth worlds may be found. The Empire continues to indoctrinate its people, leading to the culture of Resomi to be one of a collectivist society that views outsiders as threats and vehemently distrusts AI technology. It is after all, "the citizen's duty to not leave, for doing so could threaten the rest of the galaxy."

### Technology

Resomi technology has stagnated since the synthetic rebellion, but prior to this major event, the Resomi boasted technology that surpassed that of the Skrell, surpassing them in the field of micro-machining, medical sciences and Artifical Intelligence. One of the most impressive relics from before the plague was the creation of Nanomachines.

The usage of Nanomachines drastically changed the course of Resomi history, allowing them to rapidly produce nearly any structure and expand their space to fill up enough star systems to rival even the largest stellar empires. Over time, Nanomachine technology was refined and began influencing the field of medicine, allowing for Nanomachine therapy, and eventually the ability to manipulate neurons in the brain through the usage of "skill shots".

As a result of extensive neural and nano-scale machinery research, Skill shots were first created in the year 2470. Skill shots are an injection capable of repathing neurons and injecting hormones to either increase the speed a Resomi learns on a current subject, or with some of the more experimental skill shots, give them the information in its entirety in one disorienting blow.

The technology of skill shots, along with other forms of nanomachine technology, has been lost from time since the banning of all related technology during the nano plague crisis. The loss of nano-scale fabrication has resulted in a technology shock that has set back the entire empire centuries in lost investments and technology, along will the unintended death of millions of Resomi as the empire was forced to find its new population stasis with the sudden and irreparable damage to its infrastructure.

Ironically, before the Crash and the following Nanoplague, Artifical Intelligence was engraved into nearly every facet of society- Intelligent, Learning and Incredibly helpful to the species as a whole, enablling unprecedented levels of micromanagement, efficiency and effectiveness in nearly every given field. In modern times, however, AI Research in it's entirety has been lost, destroyed and forgotten- For a very good reason.

### Culture and Society

Traditionally, Resomii Culture was colorful, focusing heavily on the arts, personal freedom and strong familial relations with one's pack and relations with other packs. Resomi were, generally everywhere, allowed to live lives of relative luxury, at even the lowest parts of society. Entirely connected by AI frameworks and able to commune socially at a moment's notice. Pack relations were considered highly important, as it (still does) help define where one belongs in society- A pack born to miners, will likely stay miners without exceptional effort on a pack's part. The specifics of how this all came to be are lost to time, however.

However, in the Modern, Post-Crash Era, Society is rebuilding from the ruins of the Crash, and a strong dichotomy is reinforced in the current society about the roles of each gender. Males, with their short fertility windows, often make up the bulk of the workforce and Females kept to more clerical or roles related to upkeep. A select few Females, however, are chosen to become "Broodmothers", Resomii that breed for life and are often seen as heroes- giving up their lives for the betterment of the entire Empire to help rebuild the dwindling population of the Post-Crash Empire. Strong Stigmas exist about how Females and Males should act, look, behave- While in their packs, everyone is equal. With the loss of the AI Framework, Society has had to cope with the loss of instantaneous relationships.

On Sirisai, and it's colonies, often have work quotas for anyone in the workforce. This applies to essentially all packs, but those who are hospitalized (either for mental or physical reasons). In theory, these quotas are malleable to help those who cannot reach the standard ones, achieve one they can. In practice, they tend to be unnmoving, unless there is a serious disadvantage that a pack is dealing with (some of it is hospitalized or otherwise seriously disabled). This causes a serious amount of controversy, as packs in far reaching places aren't always able to meet these quotas. What these quotas are, depends on what kind of work they're doing. (e.g. miners excavating a certain amount of tonnage in a Sirisian Month.) Those who fail to meet their quotas are often evicted from their residencies and fined, if their behavior does not drastically improve within the first few warnings they receive- They are imprisoned and often reduced to slave labor. If they do not behave in those conditions- They are simply starved.

Education, has seen a drastic change since the removal of skill shots in common use. Before the Crash, Education was lax in the Traditional sense. Packs were assigned a counselor of sorts that blurred the lines between "Medical Professional", "Scientist" and "Professor" (referring to the one relating to education.). As soon as these were removed, Education changed drastically.

Education now, is mostly practical and vocational. Resomi are taught how to do things, and the basics of how things work, based off of what the pack they're in is assigned to. Additionally, an Educational Counselor is assigned to 6-10 packs, and each specialize in instructing in a specific field. Very few Resomi actually become Counselors, and there are few dedicated Scholars in Resomi society- as everything is focused on "Working" and not "How does it work?".

Resomi Cuisine is another point of interest. Resomii, as an entirely carnivorous species, eats primarily meat. These meats tended to be prepared with colorful, tasty sauces made with fungus and bacteria generally only found on Sirisai's Equator. Pre-Crash Resomii tended to herd and breed large "Fungus Walkers" that used to dominate the surface of Sirisai and were domesticated early in Resomi society and serve as the staple of the pre-crash Resomi diet. Other animals were also prepared, sauced and decorated, but are often seen as delicacies. The sauces uses are often either spicy or savory in taste, with some more exotic flavors being sour or sweet- Due to the relatively small varieties of flora traditionally found on Sirisai. Modern times have introduced other spices, obviously- and the small amount of plant matter is generally inoffensive to the Resomi Stomach. Resomi "sweets" are often made of fermented and distilled fungus extract and mixed with naturally occurring sugars found in specific breeds of bacteria to form various candies- all of which are generally offensive to a human, when it comes to taste.

With the bringing of the Crash, brought down several key trade lanes that imported food to several colonies- resulting in starvation nearly everywhere. Until these trade lanes were fixed, Cuisine was reduced for a while to nutrient paste and meat substitutes- In some places, this still occurs and has left it's mark as a cheap, albeit poor, bland option of nutrition.

With the Crash, and the near collapse of the Empire as a whole, has brought up the biggest resurgence of crime the Empire has ever seen- Resistance Groups calling for the violent overthrow of the Empire, Information Runners who help facilitate the entirety of clandestine undergrounds, to even overzealous Social Rights Activists who demand a return to the old ways and, in some cases, the re-activation of the AI Framework. All of these tend to operate clandestinely as Rameriti, and the Ministry of the Interior are nearly omnipresent- and do not appreciate dissidence.

The Resomi home world is named Sirisai, the precise location of which is kept hidden from foreigners as much as possible. Travel to and from Sirisai is heavily restricted and generally takes place via dedicated 'carrier' ships that can make the requisite warp jump with passenger ships safely contained inside.

### Governance

In many ways, the Empire of Sirisai is a complete and total despotic Oligarchy, with Ministers forming a Senate and the average citizen having little to no say in the Senate's actions.

The Current leader of this oligarchy is Rameriti, often seen as a God-Emperor by the average citizen, the origins of how he came to power are lost to time, Rumors circulate that Rameriti is actually in control of the old AI framework, but such rumors are nothing more than hearsay.

The often mentioned "Ministries" of the Empire are responsible for overseeing both Colonial and Core World activity that pertains to them and often have a cruel, Iron fist that is used to project their power. Known Ministries include:

* Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Handles all dealing with foreign entities.
* Ministry of Internal Affairs: Their purview is dealing with all internal entities.
* Ministry of the Interior: Keeps the other Ministries in check and preforms Intelligence on both interior and exterior threats.
* Ministry of Defense: Handles all matters involving the military.

### Relationships

In short, most Resomii from the Core Colonies who have fled, are generally wary of their new situation, but likely are trying their best to blend into their new home. Some Resomii are born outside of Sirisian Jurisdiction and are less influenced by their culture, generally.

* FTU/Corporate space: Minor Contact. Most Resomi seen in corporate space are those that are born outside of Sirisian Jurisdiction or are Refugees.
* Sol: Minor Contact. Humans are not allowed in Empire space.
* The Skrell: Minor Contact. Skrell are not allowed in Empire space.
* Dionaea gestalts: No contact. Dionaea are not allowed in Empire space.
* Vox Shoal: At War; Vox are seen as aggressive, violent creatures that prey on Resomi without mercy. Vox consumption of living Resomi do not help this image.
* Ahdomai: No contact.
* Moghes Hegemony: No contact .
* The Kharmaan Ascent: Informally at War; Intermittent conflict, Border disputes.
* The Positronic Union: Presence known; being Synthetics of non-Resomi origin they are watched dangerously close, but no conflict has been recorded as of yet.
