# The Resomi

## An Overview

The Resomi are a species of (quite small) feathered reptiles from a barren and freezing planet on the far spinward side of Skrellian territory from Sol. Their society is built around unity and strong familial and social ties; a lone Resomi is not capable of functioning well for long, and will rapidly fall into loneliness and paranoia. Despite, or perhaps because of, their small stature, the Resomi wrought a multi-system-spanning empire when humanity was building pyramids, achieving great feats of engineering, mechanics and material fabrication. At their height, the unified empire bent vast amounts of matter into shape around their home stars to build machines that harnessed staggering quantities of power, supplying a true utopia for the Resomi people.

This, however, has proven unsustainable, and without the driving forces of innovation, social entropy, or a drive to escape death, the Resomi empire has fallen from its peak, with outlying systems splintering away as the ruling government, bolstered by life-extending technology, has fallen into self-contemplation and corruption. While the Resomi are still a powerful inter-system trading force, responsible for supplying medical and materials technology (far outstripping a lot of what humans can offer) to the general market, they are not the industrial and military juggernaut they were five hundred years ago, and often must rely on applying force to the commercial markets to try and press their political claims.

### Technology

In many ways, Resomi are equivalent in technology to the Skrell or humanity (thanks to the scale-evening effect of an unregulated interstellar trading economy), especially in fields like FTL and shipbuilding. Resomi spacecraft tend to be quite small and robust, with efficient and heavily optimized sytems, but differ from human and Skrell craft most significantly in their approach to automation. Employing learning artificially intelligent systems in any capacity on a Resomi vessel (or in a Resomi dwelling) is one of the most severe crimes under imperial law; it's considered a denigration of the worth of your fellows, a rejection of the unity of Resomi culture, and an extremely dangerous step away from the traits that bore the Resomi to interstellar eminence. Strong AI is particularly banned when dealing with the golden age imperial technology like the Dyson rings due to the potential for immense damage if a malfunction occurs.

Nanotechnology and nanoswarms/nanofields are a field of particular interest to the Resomi in the modern age, as it is becoming apparent that a better understanding of these devices will allow for much easier maintenance requirements on the Dyson rings, as well as a wide range of applications in day to day life or when travelling amongst foreign cultures. Many Resomi will be equipped with adaptive nanomachines slaved to a control implant in their owner's spine rather than a voidsuit or pressurized exoskeleton; they make up for in flexibility and self-repair capacity what they lack in armour and size. This technology tends to be rare outside of Resomi space due to the cost and manufacturing requirements of the control units, as well as the mind-writing technology needed to properly integrate the spinal control unit.

'Skill shots' are a form of Resomi technology that is rarely found outside of core imperial systems. They use nanomachine injections to overwrite targeted sections of the recipient's brain with new data, which is claimed by their manufacturers to be used to quickly teach new skills to trainees. Darker rumours abound of the potential for this technology to be used for indoctrination, brainwashing, or to copy the minds of the dead onto a new 'host' body if immortality finally escapes them, and objective clinical data is available that shows potentially crippling neurological damage resulting from routine mind-writing. The technology is heavily restricted in Skrellian and human space where it isn't outright banned.

### Physiology and Biology

The Resomi are very small, rarely reaching more than 3-4'/1m in height, and weigh less than 90lbs/40kg. They have rapid metabolisms and very efficient digestive systems, and thanks to extensive genetic engineering conducted over their development as an interstellar power, they tend to have robust and effective immune systems and very few of the genetic disorders and maladies that plague contemporary humanity.

They evolved for a very cold and very barren world, almost outside of the Goldilocks zone and unfit for life as humanity understands it. Because of this, their skin is a fine insulator and many of their internal processes are not particularly energy-efficient; they cannot cope well at all with high temperatures. Their eyes are poorly suited to ambient light levels on human stations, as they evolved as pack hunters in near-constant darkness.

Their hearing is exceptionally sensitive to the point that they can detect a person moving on the other side of a wall, but comes at the cost of being extremely vulnerable to sonic weaponry like flashbangs. This powerful hearing makes up for their lack of long-distance or high-accuracy eyesight.

The Resomi are omnivorous due to careful genetic manipulation early in their development as a stellar empire, but generally prefer to eat meat wherever possible.

### Lifecycle

A breeding pair of Resomi, generally supported by their social grouping/pack, will lay a clutch of eggs and tend to them until they hatch.
The parenthood of the resulting children is generally irrelevant; the entire pack is their family and protectors, although their blood parents may have a status similar to that of an favourite uncle or aunt in human culture.
Depending on the culture of their society, Resomi children may enter the workforce as soon as they are old enough, be placed in education, or take up a vocation; they are as varied and complex as any human culture would be.
Depending on the influence of the pack, Resomi may be able to obtain 'skill shots' or life extension treatments if they are under the broad wing of the core empire. These allow the richer Resomi to become more skilled and live longer than their peers (although often at a significant cost, either material or in the form of being tied closely to the core system government).
When a Resomi dies, they are buried according to the customs of their people. In the core systems, this is often a sky burial or cremation, depending on time and space constraints.

### Culture and Society

There is a saying amongst the Ministry: 'a single Resomi is a rounding error'. Every facet of Resomi culture is focused on the group rather than the individual; generally, the action of a single Resomi reflects on their entire pack, and the achievements and shame of an individual are those of their pack. This also extends into government, military action, trade agreements, and so on. The core systems are significantly more uniform in culture than the colonies and fringe, but still demonstrate huge variations in things as basic as language and cuisine, as would be expected with an ancient interstellar empire.

The modern empire tends to be rigidly controlled in the core systems, but more lax the further out you go; even Resomi living in Skrell or Human space are expected to toe the line of government mandates, though, and the punishments for colonies or individuals found to be neglecting their duties to their rulers range from fines to total trade embargoes of planets or systems, resulting in their starvation. This latter punishment has drawn the ire of Skrell and Human representatives, as a handful of outlying Resomi planets have petitioned neighbouring alien cultures for humanitarian aid.

Resomi tend to build low, open-roofed dwellings with plenty of room for leaping and gliding, although this is an increasingly rare architectural style on imperial worlds where living space is at a premium. Living spaces will be owned by entire packs rather than individuals or couples, although smaller, one or two-person dwellings may be found within a larger territory. Even at its most solitary, Resomi society has nothing that a human would call privacy.

The Resomi home world is named Sirisai, the precise location of which is kept hidden from foreigners as much as possible. It is rumoured that every Minister makes their home on the birth world of their empire, and concordantly a planet-buster strike on the frozen would could decapitate the entire empire. Travel to and from Sirisai is heavily restricted and generally takes place via dedicated 'carrier' ships that can make the requisite warp jump with passenger ships safely contained inside.

## Miscellanious Information

### Relationships

* FTU/Corporate space: They are a major interstellar trading partner for a number of exo-solar corporations and with their introduction to humanity have started making waves in markets traditionally dominated by Free Trade Union bodies. They buy a great deal of phoron from human companies.
* Sol: Cordial due to an alliance with the Skrell, but humanitarian concerns from Sol regarding outlying Resomi worlds have placed some tension on political discourse.
* The Skrell: Long-standing allies. The Skrell carefully try to steer the Resomi towards participating in galactic politics and possibly revitalizing their stagnant empire.
* Dionaea gestalts: Treated as part of the Skrell bloc.
* Vox Shoal: Kill on sight. Pls stop eating everyone, shitbirds.
* Ahdomai: No contact.
* Moghes Hegemony: No contact.
* The Kharmaan Ascent: Intermittent warfare and border scuffles. The Resomi REALLY do not approve of the Kharmaan reliance on artificial intelligence.

### Language

Both their names and their language are based off of avoiding guttural sounds, such as uh, er, and eh. Instead, they use light trilling sounds, such as a, ee, and eh. For example, names of Resomi would be as such; Remi, Seemoni, Ritila, and Eschomi. The name of this language is Schechi.
