Today, popularity has tapered off, and Professional smokers are often seen as flashy, or out of style.

**Space Cola:** Space Cola is the most popular soft drink in known space.  It was invented by Nikolas Fedorov, a Martian-Russian immigrant to Tau Ceti.  He then went on to create Federov Beverages Inc., a soft drink corporation that is now part of [Centauri Provisions](https://baystation12.net/lore/Section%203).

**Bottled Water:** This is a generic, [NanoTrasen](https://baystation12.net/lore/Corporations/NanoTrasen) branded bottle of water.  The company swears on the quality of the water, saying it comes from the Martian poles.  Most people disregard that and assume it's recycled from hydroponics trays.

**Space Mountain Wind:** This cola was allegedly made after Vasily Federov, the son of Nikolas Federov and the second CEO of Federov Beverages Inc., went on a climbing expedition to an arctic planet.  He then created this citrus flavored soft drink.  Scientists claim that it can eat through a block of styrofoam in a matter of weeks, but people drink it anyway.

**Thirteen Loko:** A beverage loved by college students.  The Thirteen Loko Company created this highly alcoholic beverage as an energy drink.  It is illegal in much of SolGov space and most of Skrell space.  This drink has been regulated more than any other in known space, and doctors strongly advise not to drink it.

**Dr. Gibb:** Originally made by a doctor seeking to mix several different flavors, this soda has become widely popular in the past decade.  The drink has become so popular, in fact, that Federov Beverages bought it.  Ever since then, the drink has never been the same.  As a result, people all across known space beg for the old formula, but Federov Beverages does not appear to be listening.

**Federov Beverages' attempt at an orange-flavored drink.  Advertised as a nice summer beverage.  The company tries to paint it as one of their more 'healthy' beverages due to its 'orange' and 'vitamins'.

**Star-Kist:** This drink is advertised as one of the most carbonated beverages on the market.  It's owned by Federov Beverages, and advertised for its carbonation, not its flavor.

**Lemon-Lime:** This is a NanoTrasen branded can of Lemon-Lime juice.  NanoTrasen swears to their 'natural' beverage, but most people think differently.  It was never as popular as their now discontinued Oh-Range brand.

**Vrisk Iced Tea:** Vrisk Iced Tea is named after it's creator, Penelope Vrisk.  She was a canner for Federov Beverages who wanted to create an authentic-tasting Southern iced tea.  After finishing her formula and managing to get it produced, the tea became an instant hit.

**Grapnel Juice:** This is a NanoTrasen branded can of grape juice.  NanoTrasen claims that they use the same grapes that this juice is made of to make their wine.

**T-Borg's Tonic Water:** Endorsed by the popular positronic rapper, T-Borg, this drink is advertised as a 'high class' drink.  Most people just use it to mix with their gin, and not much can be said about the quality.

**Soda Water:** This is a NanoTrasen branded can of soda water.  They use the same water for this that they use for the bottled water that they sell.  That may explain why the stuff isn't exactly flying off of the shelves.
