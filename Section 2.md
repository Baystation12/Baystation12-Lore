#Humans, Aliens, and Monsters Oh My!

##WHAT IS THAT THING!

As you may have noticed from your time on our server, Humanity is not alone in the stars. So far, there are seven other alien civilizations that we have discovered, and that's just the start of our galaxy! Who knows what else lurks in the dark corners...
Anyways, these species were already described on the previous Section in short little paragraphs that gave you a basic idea. This section is meant to give you a more comprehensive understanding of these Aliens, and perhaps prepare you to even play them!

##That's only five aliens, where's the other two?

As you can imagine, not every species gets along. The Kharmaani Ascent and the Vox also exist amongst the stars. The Kharmaani Ascent are much more powerful than the Vox, but currently things are at cold conflict, with nothing actually happening but general distrust on both sides. The Vox are relatable to Somali pirates in the 21st century when it comes to Human Policy. There is open conflict against the ones that attack our vessels, but overall no war has been declared as they are not a unified civilization.

##What's this about Monsters?

Space is a very dangerous place, and not just because there's no air. Various creatures lurk throughout the stars, all wanting to eat you. The most common are the Carp, Pikes, the main focus of the Xenobiological field- The Slimes, Giant Spiders, and Cortical Borers.
