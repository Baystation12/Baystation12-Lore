# Humans, Aliens, and Monsters Oh My!


##WHAT IS THAT THING!

As you may have noticed from your time on our server, Humanity is not alone in the stars. So far, there are seven other alien civilizations that we have discovered, and that's just the start of our galaxy! Who knows what else lurks in the dark corners...
Anyways, these species were already described on the previous Section in short little paragraphs that gave you a basic idea. This section is meant to give you a more comprehensive understanding of these Aliens, and perhaps prepare you to even play them!

[**Humanity**](http://baystaton12.net/lore/Humanity)

One of the more prominent species in our area of the Galaxy, Humanity has certainly expanded across the stars since their first contact with the Skrell in the 25th century. Since then, they have spread out, colonized or conquered, and built for themseles a Solar Empire that is under control of the powerful Sol Central (or Sol Gov), based out of the heart of Human Politics, the Terran Commonwealth. Trans-Stellar Corporations push Humanity into further reaches of space, and are at the bleeding edge of new technology. In recent days, the discovery of the phoron giant in Nyx have fueled investments and jobs, brining many Humans to the outer rim of their controlled systems, as well as many subversive organizations that have a variety of different agendas. 

[**Skrell**](https://baystation12.net/lore/The-Skrell)

Hailing from the jungles and marshes of Qerr'balak, Humanity's oldest ally, and one of the two most powerful known civilizations: the Skrell. They are far more technologically advanced than Humanity, and have been around this point for near 600 years, with technological advancements stagnating (though still far ahead of Humanity). They are at the top of Galactic prowess, with them being the firsrt Empire Humanity ever met in the stars. They are responsible for many advancements that Humanity has acquired, and for keeping the Peace, mostly, between the younger species. In the 25th century, the Skrell's war with the Kharmaani Ascent came to a close, bringing in the 26th Century with it and today's society.

[**Unathi**](http://baystation12.net/lore/The-Unathi)

a proud race of reptilians hailing from the desert planet of Moghes, the Unathi are a recent addition to the International Community. They are a highly sexist society, and to some, considered xenophobic too. They are very much in keeping with their own traditions and staying out of intergalactic affairs, and as such, it is rare to see them out in the stars and away from home.

[**Tajara**](https://baystation12.net/lore/The-Tajara)

A newer addition to the galactic community, the Tajara are a form of cheap labor throughout the stars, and they haven't been found to do much else. For a long time until a revolution took place they were ruled over by a class known as the "Slavemasters" and in recent years finally made it on their own into the stars, but society is still very divided for them. They're based around family, traditions, and hard work.

## That's Only Five Aliens

As you can imagine, not every species gets along. The Kharmaan Ascent and the Vox also exist amongst the stars. The Kharmaan Ascent are much more powerful than the Vox, but currently things are at cold conflict, with nothing actually happening but general distrust on both sides. The Vox are relatable to Somali pirates in the 21st century when it comes to Human Policy. There is open conflict against the ones that attack our vessels, but overall no war has been declared as they are not a unified civilization.

**Kharmaan Ascent**

The Kharmaan Ascent is an interstellar power located in neighbouring space to the Skrell. The full extent of their territory is unknown, as it abuts the intergalactic gulf and Humanity is walled off from it by a narrow buffer of several Skrellian systems. Access to Ascent space is solely afforded through a series of interdicted DMZ systems littered with the debris of space battles both ancient and modern, and their borders are policed by breathtakingly violent and reactionary automated military squadrons. They are enormously advanced, insectoid in appearance, and number amongst the most vicious and violent aliens Humanity has ever encountered.

##What's This About Monsters?

Space is a very dangerous place, and not just because there's no air. Various creatures lurk throughout the stars, all wanting to eat you. The most common are the Carp, Pikes, the main focus of the Xenobiological field- The Slimes, Giant Spiders, and Cortical Borers.
