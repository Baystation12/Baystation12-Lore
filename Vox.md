# The Vox


## Vox History 

Three thousand years ago the Vox civilization crumbled. Of the four types of Vox, only the Primalis remained. At first, this was fine. The Primalis have always made up the majority of Vox and their systems of hierarchy kept their civilization in check for a while. Then one particularly nasty Vox captain (Now known only as Rolling Fire) decided they were worthy of being a new Auralis, and                                                                                                                            with twelve thousand Vox at its command, began to take control. Numerous smaller factions quickly rose up to contest this, eventually leading to an all out war.

Rolling Fire died early in the war, killed in his sleep by his first officer (known as Metal Shriek). The war raged on for ten years, killing the majority of the Primalis population and destroying multiple arkships. Much of the Vox’s knowledge was lost to time, including the locations of many of the remaining arkships. What was left of Vox civilization was a small, dwindling group of feuding Vox hellbent on killing one another.

The saving grace for the Vox was not by nature, or any altruistic motive to further propagate the Vox species. Instead, it was an arms race. The Vox at this point, were still at war, however there were only a couple hundred Vox left, and they were too evenly matched to even consider fighting. So they needed more Vox. More soldiers, more workers, more meat to put against the grindstone of their war. So they took to the arkships.

It took ten years for one of the remaining Vox factions to salvage enough old technology to figure out how to produce a Vox larva. It used this technology to amass an army and slaughter the rest of the Vox.

### Historical Figures

*“Vox never dead. Vox live on in word and metal.”*
* Rolling Fire - a short lived but vicious leader. Got his namesake from the unique way his ship’s exhaust bellows out of his engines. Is known primarily for starting the great Vox war and promptly dying to his second in command. Is oftentimes used as a lesson in following superiority, where Metal Shriek is seen as the superior one. Could be said as an insult or a threat to indicate that the subject is not as strong as they think themselves to be or that they might end up dead, fast. (E.G. You better watch tongue, Rolling Fire. Or find self like namesake.)
* Metal Shriek - Known primarily for killing Rolling Fire and asserting itself as leader, it ruled about as long as Rolling managed to, dying to a faulty engine explosion. His heir was quickly chosen and he was promptly forgotten, save for when the story of Rolling Fire was told.

## The Vox 

### Half Vox

*“99 halfs for 1 head? No good. Shit. 1 head kill 100 halfs easy. Plus have to feed halfs 99 more than one head.”*

Cortical stacks are a finite resource. The technology and knowledge used to create them died with the Vox’s masters. But they are still important, extremely important. A Vox with a cortical stack can be strong, fast, smart, clever, or any mixture inbetween. A Vox without one is smelly, dumb, and slow. Power can be gained through stacks, just as they can be gained through pools.

‘Half Vox’ as they are called, are treated relatively the same as regular vox outside the typical scorn a Vox has for its inferiors. They can win Disputes, fight battles alongside others, and work towards their factions goal. However most Halfs have some sort of retainer, or ‘half-herder’. One herder usually takes care of around ten to fifty halfs, depending on how strained a faction is on regular vox. Most halfs find themselves on the bottom rung of the hierarchy, just on their typical merit alone. Though there have been times when a half has risen steadily and in even rarer cases, deemed worthy of a stack.

### Bio-Pools

*“It not just meat go in, Vox come out. Put in wrong meat, wrong Vox.”*

Bio-pools are the instruments scrapped together by the Vox to propagate their species. Fueled by mysterious chemicals and pure biological matter, they spew out a steady supply of Vox larvae, if properly maintained. They are fickle machines, and only through trial and error have they become usable and maintained. 

Each Vox costs a faction approximately 500 thaler to birth. Cortical stack implants also require careful surgery, which could, depending on the stack and its wear and tear, cost this expense to skyrocket. On top of the regular cost of living, Vox are inexpensive to make.

Thousands of years of use have made the Vox very adept at using them, some even being gifted enough to modify the results. These Vox, ‘shapers’ as they are called, are prized amongst their factions, considered even more valuable than a stack. They demand many things from the other Vox, usually chemicals or meat, in their experimentations. Each shaper strives to create the pinnacle of Vox, to recreate the legends of the past.


### Vox Dispute

*“Meat versus meat. Metal versus metal. Strongest wins. Strongest leads.”*

The Vox hierarchy can be explained in one simple sentence: Strongest on top, weakest on bottom. Vox determine rank by challenge. When a Vox thinks themselves better than another Vox, they challenge them to a Dispute. A Dispute can be anything, as long as it has a victor. Brawls, insults, drinking contests, the Dispute is decided by the Vox being challenged and determined ‘fair’ by either their opponent or other Vox nearby. Time is given to both participants to prepare, usually a few minutes though in particularly extreme cases up to a month. During a Dispute the Vox’s crew or whomever is nearby must form a circle around the participants and help judge its outcome.

The cultural impact of the Dispute causes most Vox leaders to be very extreme in one way or another. Either extremely brutish, clever, fast, or having an extreme of one skill or another. The existence of the Dispute has also kept the Vox together, turning near-violent arguments between factions into either a joining of the two, or giving some sort of peace.

### Vox War

*“A Vox prepared for war cautious. Vox that fight war stupid.”*

Vox are cowards, but greedy. War for most Vox is the last straw, the last avenue of approach, but it is still an option. Death, destruction, and murder are both scary and risky, two things Vox do not enjoy. However, war is occasionally necessary and a Vox faction not prepared for war is one that's unprepared for survival.

Vox warfare is one part planning, one part action and two parts image. A faction will get together their most powerful leaders and figure out the best course of action (with much debate, argument, and rattling of quills) A war against non-Vox is quite simple, since Disputes can’t be made against them, leaving the two most popular options, trade and raiding. Trading with non-Vox isn’t unheard of and easily profitable, however non-Vox often want silly nonsensical things (like clothing, oxygen, etc) that most Vox do not carry on hand. Raiding is dangerous but doesn’t require Vox to gather nonsensical items, and if the Vox are sneaky and skilled enough the chances of them being confronted are miniscule at best.

Fighting other Vox is a whole different story as Disputes and the Law has to be taken into account. Warring against other Vox is a tricky business, it can make you seem violent and untrustworthy, other factions might decide to break contact with you or worse, group together to fight you if they deem you a threat, add onto this the cowardly nature of most Vox it makes inter-Vox battles very rare.

The most common method of ‘fighting’ Vox is to win a Dispute with a high ranking member of the opposing faction, one with enough clout to convince the enemy faction’s Vox to leave, preferably for their own faction and either keep doing this until the other faction dissolves or becomes a non-issue. The strategy behind this is simple, find a loyal Vox who is skilled enough at whatever challenge the opposing Vox might throw at them. Asking around about the target faction, figuring out their interests and skills, finding out what possible Disputes they could win by cross referencing what skills their faction’s Vox have and what the opposing has, as well as figuring out what the opposing faction might attempt to use as a challenge to blindside the attackers. It's a constant flow of information that only the most competent and clever Vox use to their advantage.

Defending against a Dispute is much easier, as it is a defenders game. A Vox prepares for two things: An impromptu challenge, of which they will probably easily win, and a prepared one, which the Vox needs to think on their feet for. A planned challenge is easy to spot, usually an unfamiliar Vox, perhaps flanked by two equally unrecognizable Vox, challenging them with more confidence than usually seen. The defending Vox has to make a decision: set the challenge to something they are familiar, and good at, and bank on their skill being better than the others, or think of a new challenge that would catch the other Vox off guard. What if the Vox counted on that and chose someone who was good at their second choice? Their third? In a matter of seconds the Vox has to choose the challenge, or seem cowardly.

Another more upfront and aggressive method is to raid them. Vox are cowards, and a simple show of force, be it aggressively pointing guns at them, circling their encampment with their ships, or screaming a battle cry at them, driving Vox off of whatever they want can be a simple endeavor. Sneaking onboard, capturing guards and stealing shiny valuable things, is also common, often times valuables are ‘ping ponged’ between factions as they raid each other until the original owner is forgotten.

But when push comes to shove, when a mix of desperation and anger comes to a climax, occasionally Vox will attack each other with the intent of murdering each other. As with accordance with Vox Law, this is made public (and as a side effect, could scare the opposing faction into giving into their demands) and then, war.

### Vox Law

*“All Vox have rules. You know what Vox no have rules? Rolling Fire. Wake up with head off. You follow rule or end up like Rolling, I promise.”*

It is said that before the war, there was once a universal Vox law that when broken would curse a Vox to a life of pain and torture, and that any Vox caught cursed would be forgotten forever. Many Vox factions have attempted to rekindle this old legend into a new set of universal Vox laws, however many can’t agree on laws like “all vox answer to The Grey Quills” or “no kill other vox”. But as time went on, a few unofficial rules have taken permanent residence, their punishment varying between factions though typically it involves them being removed from protection of said laws, a punishment that can be considered worse than death.
The rules are as followed:

* Do not destroy cortical stacks, if possible. They cannot be replaced.
* Vox trading is honorable and without deception.
* A Vox dispute must be made clear. No surprise challenges.
* No assassinations. Death must be clear.

Of course, these do not apply to non-Vox.

### Arkships

*“Home. It is where we from. Now is dead.”*

Known Arkships, or what is left of them, are highly disputed areas, constantly exchanging hands as more and more blood is spilled for them. They are a constant source of knowledge and materials, though their insides can be extremely deadly. More than one Vox has gotten lost in their winding and twisting corridors, more than one has set off a security system planted by their old masters and paid the price. But still, more and more Vox go in, the artifacts within promising them honor, respect, and fame amongst their peers.

There are three known Arkships, one of which is wholly intact, the other two having been destroyed into smaller pieces. The intact Arkship is referred to as Cracked Whole, due to its shell being somewhat fractured yet it is still entirely intact. The two broken Arkships are referred to as Shit Thing and Other Shit Thing respectively, with specific pieces named by size and shape (Big Shit Thing, Little But Not Too Little Other Shit Thing, Round Shit Thing, etc)


### Vox Legends

* Apik - The Apik were large Vox, bigger than an entire ship, with many hands and arms. They were the caretakers of the Vox and created them in big gardens.
* Aralis - The truest of Vox. They were smart and extremely powerful, their cortical stacks allowed them to see into the future. Practical gods.
* Amalis - The most powerful of Vox, from which all current Vox were made. They were the size of five Vox stacked ontop of each other and could swipe down a mountain in one blow.

### Factions/Groups

#### Blue Talons

*“Blood blood blood. All Vox want now. So is give to em”*

One of the oldest factions, having existed for over 500 years, probably due to their policy of destroying entire crews for slights against them. They are the most vicious and mean of the Vox, taking resources through force and violence. The Talons live near the pieces of Shit Thing, not on it but near it. They make a habit of letting others take Shit Thing and waiting for one faction to gain complete control of it so that they can slaughter them, either for resources or sport.

Those born from the Talons have ragged and infected talons, gained from a genetic modification that was supposed to make them stronger (it doesn’t). The Talons kept it as it made for good intimidation, though it does pain the Vox inflicted by it. The Talons wear only one tattoo, their faction symbol, on the front of their chests. When a Talon gets into a Dispute or fight they bear their chest and bear their talons in an attempt to intimidate them by faction alone. Talon halves are notoriously belligerent and violent, raised as pure cannon fodder to weaken their enemy.

The Talons number around 10 to 15 thousand, made up of approximately 75% halves and 25% wholes. They number at roughly 25% food-makers, 10% metal-shapers, 5% quills, and 60% warriors. They subside primarily on grown fungus and raided foodstuffs. They prefer frontal armor plates alongside helmets, even over weaponry. Their main weapons are their ships large spike throwers alongside any weapons they’ve raided.

#### Circle of Metals
*“All things have cost.”*

The Circle of Metals is a collection of small Vox factions united through one thing: commerse.

#### The Dirt

*“We is dirt. Always been, always be.”*

Dirt is not a faction, it's an idea. The idea that Vox are inherently dirt, and all that they’ve ever done is ruin themselves through greed, violence, and stupidity. That they are only worth as much as dirt. Members of ‘The Dirt’ are both rare and disorganized, they have no base of operation or any known gene-line.

Typically new Dirt members are recruited from other groups, single Vox selected by a member to be taught the ways of Dirt. These teachings can last from a few months to a few years until the teacher Vox is satisfied the recruit is knowledgeable enough. When the teacher is done, the student is given the name, “Dirt” as a symbol of their newfound ‘enlightenment’. It is then they split ways, probably to never see each other again.

Dirt members are typically quiet and introspective. They are as greedy as other Vox, however they, through their teachings, have learned to control that aspect of themselves. Dirt members are almost always wholes, though the rare half member comes about. They are all wanderers, going from Vox settlement to settlement, staying only as long as they can be tolerated by the local faction, some even traveling to non-Vox stations, though this is rare as a Dirt’s lifespan is usual cut quite short.

Dirts are usually equipped with shoddily made weapons and armor, either given to them by their teacher or scrounged up on their own. They typically refuse grander trinkets and clothing for two reasons: 1. They are taught it is greedy and 2. They do not want to attract the eye of local Vox, most of which would be glad to shake them down for it, or worse.

#### Other Factions

Each Vox faction is different, as all Vox factions come about from disagreements. One Vox wants one thing, another wants another, yet
