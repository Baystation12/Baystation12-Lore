# Big Brother and the Government

With Civilization comes laws, government, and power. The things that, inherently, make civilization civilization, and not barbarianism.
Each of the stellar species has their own government, one in control of the mass majority of their populations, and humanity is no 
different.
Out there in the stars, the great arms of the Sol Central Government, extend beyond Humanity's home system, finding new stars, establishing order, and attempting to bring peace to chaos. How does it work? well lets see.

# The Sol Central Government

![The Sol Central Government Flag][1]

The Sol Central Government, commonly referred to as SolGov, the SCG, or Sol Central is a federal republic composed of numerous human 
states across many solar systems, which governs, directly or indirectly, the majority of human space. Its primary governing bodies are
the Assemblies, which are in turn led by a Secretary-General, who is elected by the Assemblies. Member states have a great degree of
freedom in their actions, while the SCG manages sapient rights, security, the economy, and diplomacy for humanity as a whole. It has a
diverse population, including many non-humans, and encompasses a wide range of systems, territories, habitats, and stellar bodies. The
Sol Central Government and its member states make up one of the more advanced and powerful civilizations in the known galaxy.

## The History of SolGov

When Humanity first started colonizing the Solar System, it was under the banner of the Old Earth, nation-states like China, America, and India planted their flags in the dirt of planets and moons throughout the system. Shortly behind them the private corporations followed, establishing corporate outposts and research stations away from the prying eyes of Earth. As the situation on Earth deteriorated, the colonies funded by corporations grew more powerful in the absence of oversight, and the colonies that eventually lost contact with their parent nation-states were left on their own. While some withered, being forced to fend for themselves, and others disappeared entirely, the strongest banded together and started to form some of the settlements and governments that we know so well today. As the flow of people from Earth grew, so did the settlements that had survived.

When Old Earth eked out a unified government under the banner of the Terran Commonwealth, it found a Solar System that had grown and developed independent of Earther control. When the Commonwealth re-exerted its power over its colonies, many places found themselves underrepresented by a body that did not have Colonial interests in mind. Eventually, war broke out. A few Martian colonies band together to form the Ares Confederation, and fight to gain their freedom. The first interstellar wars take a toll on development, but end in victory for the Commonwealth.

While full control over the Solar System may have been what the Commonwealth wanted, it wasn't what the Commonwealth needed, at least after Humanity slipped the bonds of its Solar System. Forced to confront its powerlessness to control an Inter-System collection of highly varied colonies, the Commonwealth devises a solution.

The Sol Central Government was created under the guiding principles of the Solar Declaration of Rights, which eventually became the Universal Declaration of Rights, based off of the Declaration of Human Rights of old United Nations. Recognizing the growth of Mars into a scientific and military powerhouse in Sol, the capital of SolGov is established on the red planet. All former members of the Commonwealth are allowed, finally, true determination as to whether or not they join the new system, and most do. As the role of the Corporations in founding the SCGB could not be understated, they were given status on the same level as the other states. SolGov handles such broad questions as direction of Humanity, and as mundane problem as trade regulations, and diplomacy.

The perks of membership included free trade and movement between the whole of SolGov territory, humanitarian aid to developing stations and colonies, as well as any that suffered a disaster, and eventually military protection from the criminal element that eventually followed Humanity into space. Members could enforce laws within their own borders, provided they followed the Declaration of Rights, and periodically allow observers to examine their societies for compliance.

As colonization continued in bordering systems, and time passed, and humanity continued to stretch out into the stars. SolGov shepherded the peoples of Earth, continuing and creating treaties with the Skrell, making first contact with the Unathi, and defending humanity from the Vox. Gateways and Bluespace drives allow Humans to spread further and faster than ever before. As humanity develops, so does SolGov, while recently corporations have outpaced the spread of SolGov's influence, SolGov is still highly influential in the more developed systems, and sometimes extends its light as far as the frontier, much to the annoyance of the TSCs.

## How Does it Work?

The assemblies largely form a basis for diplomacy and trade across human space, managing economic agreements, mining and environmental concerns, and ensuring Sapient Rights are upheld. For example, during the Synthetic Intelligence Rights Crisis of 2558, both the Solar and Colonial Assemblies declared Posibrains to be sapient, and therefore protected by the Universal Declaration of Rights.

While member states manage affairs that fall under SolGov's jurisdiction within their own borders, including trade agreement and diplomacy between individual member states; gateways and the spaces between states are SolGov's jurisdiction, and any SolGov personnel and outposts within a member state are considered immune from that state's laws. SolGov's main presence can be found on most colonies and stations in the form of aid missions and schools, in space protecting gateways and establishing navigational beacons in nebulae, and even on the frontier, as Colonial Marshals track down criminals that have fled from SolGov administered systems to what they think is safe anonymity. Most of SolGov's revenue comes from taxes on the use of its gateways, communication systems, and secure trade routes, typically higher for non-members, as well as regular funding by corporations and individual member states. While SolGov has no say over legal interactions between member states, it is permitted by its charter to negotiate with other political entities, human or otherwise. While the many organizations of SolGov are staffed by SolGov citizens, member states often send their own personnel to serve and gain experience.

### The Charter

*The Sol Central Government Charter is the foundational treaty of the Sol Central Government. It was signed at the Palace of Nations in Geneva, on Earth, by the Terran Commonwealth and the founding members of the SCG on 12 November 2436. It went into effect on the first day of 2437, and marked the start of a new chapter in Humanity's history. The Charter defines the workings of the Sol Central Government, codifies its laws, and organizes its members. Functioning both as a constitution and a binding treaty, the Charter is what grants the SCG its powers and responsibilities. All states that have ratified the Charter must abide by it, or risk sanctions, punishments, and even expulsion, though the latter has never occurred. The charter contains the legal code of the Sol Central Government, largely based off of the Universal Declaration of Rights. While those human states that have not ratified the Charter do not have to abide by its rules and regulations, the SCG has enforced the Universal Declaration of Rights in non-members, though only in two extreme instances.*

## The Missions of Sol Gov

### [Economic Mission](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/SCG/SCG%20Economics)

The Committee for Economic Development is responsible for managing the monetary interaction of colonies and corporations.

### [Sapientarian Mission](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/SCG/SCG%20Sapience): 

Once limited to humans, the Committee for Sapientarian Development now sets its sights on ensuring basic rights for all sapient life.

### [Diplomatic Mission](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/SCG/SCG%20Diplomacy): 

Once nothing more than the Committee that handles relations among member states and contact with the Skrell, it has expanded it's position with the inclusion of the Interstellar Assembly and the Expeditionary Corps' revival.

### [Peacekeeping Mission](https://baystation12.net/lore/Organizations/SCG/SCG%20Peace): 

Unlike the United Nations on Old Earth, SolGov maintains its own standing police and military forces, both under the aegis of the Committee of Defense and Security.

## People, Places, and Things

* Olympus, Mars:

Built into, around, and on the plains surrounding the extinct supervolcano Olympus Mons, the city of Olympus was originally a research station, terraforming center, and spaceport. Due to its location, and relative lack of development, it was selected as the Capital for the Sol Central Government in the waning days of the Terran Commonwealth and built up into a massive diplomatic and governmental center. Both Assemblies are built into the volcano itself, along with the offices of many other organizations, the High Court, the Embassy Complex, and facilities for keeping the city running. Massive transit tunnels crisscross the mountain's interior, and its surroundings. Olympus has grown significantly out around the mountain, and onto the plains around it, though the highest density of government facilities remains in the volcano itself. The inside wall of the caldera is lined with landing pads and government apartments, and the very bottom of the caldera is home to a massive park, showcasing a unique ecosystem imported from Earth.

* Gateway One, Lunar Orbit: 

While the first gateway used by humanity orbited the Earth, that first gate, connecting Sol to its closest neighbor Alpha Centauri, has since been decommissioned and is now a museum. A larger, more advanced gate was constructed in a stable orbit around Luna. One of the most heavily guarded places in human space, Gateway One is the only way to enter or exit Sol without a Bluespace Drive.

* Hermes Naval Shipyard and Orbital Drydock, Venusian Orbit:

One of the largest shipyards made by humanity, the Hermes Shipyard not only provides a stable platform for constructing vessels of peace and war, but also houses the crews and corporate offices of many corporations contracted to build ships for SolGov.

* The Sol Central Government Fleet Academy, Buenos Aires, Earth:

The SCG Fleet Academy, is a four year service academy established for the purpose of educating and training young leaders for service in the Fleet as Officers. Candidates for admission must apply directly, and receive a nomination from an Assembly representative. Graduates commission as Ensigns in the Fleet, or Second Lieutenants in the Marine Corps.

* SFV Amazon: 

Flagship of the Fleet, the Amazon is an advanced Battlecarrier, designed for command and control, and carries a large complement of marines and strike craft. It remains garrisoned in Sol with the rest of First Fleet.

* SFV Terra: 

An older ship that originally belonged to the Terran Commonwealth, converted into a museum ship, kept officially on active duty for ceremonial purposes.

* SEV Torch:

Currently sitting in drydock at the Shiva Fleet Yards undergoing final preparations for its exploratory mission, the Torch is the culmination of almost a decade of negotiations and cooperation between many organizations, both inside the government and out.

* SEV Magnus:

One of the major ships in the Expeditionary Corps, it went missing during its exploration into the far outer reaches of the Trajan System.

* Amaya Barros:

A career politician, the current Secretary-General of SolGov was born on Luna, and served in a variety of positions in SolGov before being selected to be Githari Exports' delegate on the Colonial Assembly. From there, she moved up through the Assembly, sitting as chair of the Committee for Diplomatic relations, and overseeing the creation of the Interstellar Assembly. After being selected as the next Secretary-General, Ms. Barros has shed her reputation as being soft-spoken, instead being one of the most vocal individuals on the Assembly floor.

* First Fleet: 

A mainly ceremonial force after the creation of the Home Guard, the First Fleet is permanently garrisoned in Sol, and is where all new fleet vessels are assigned until they are sent to another unit. The First Fleet does occasionally send individual vessels or groups of vessels for Public Relations missions, ceremonies, or to escort dignitaries between Sol and other systems.

* Second Fleet: 

The largest of the SGDF's fleets, Second fleet is responsible for the direct security of the SCG's interior territories, especially the systems closest to Sol. In order to cover so much space, the Second Fleet includes four carrier strike groups, and a large marine complement.

* Third Fleet: 

Assigned to border security along with Fourth Fleet, Third Fleet is considered one of the most experienced Fleets, as it regularly deals with pirate raids and Vox incursions. Battle-hardened, most Third Fleet ships and crews are not without their scars.

* Fourth Fleet:

Specifically assigned to secure the border of Skrell space, and the space that separates the Resomi Empire from humanity, the Fourth Fleet is sometimes considered the place where slackers are sent to languish, as officially they are only protecting the Skrell border. While this reputation may have been true to an extent, recent tensions have caused an overhaul of Fourth Fleet. With many incompetent or ineffective officers having been shown the door, Fourth Fleet may have to prove its mettle before long.

* Fifth Fleet:

A recent creation, still being organized and modified, the Fifth Fleet was created in 2559 by the Assemblies in order to act as a Quick Reaction Force. While it is still small, the Fifth Fleet is being staffed with some of the brightest minds of the Defense Forces, and equipped with the latest technology.
