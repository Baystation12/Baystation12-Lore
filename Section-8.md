# Big Brother and the Government

With Civilization comes laws, government, and power. The things that, inherently, make civilization civilization, and not barbarianism.
Each of the stellar species has their own government, one in control of the mass majority of their populations, and humanity is no 
different.
Out there in the stars, the great arms of Sol Gov, extend beyond Humanity's home system, finding new stars, establishing order, and
attempting to bring peace to chaos. How does it work? well lets see.

## An Overview of Sol Gov

The Sol Central Government, commonly referred to as SolGov, the SCG, or Sol Central is a federal republic composed of numerous human 
states across many solar systems, which governs, directly or indirectly, the majority of human space. Its primary governing bodies are
the Assemblies, which are in turn led by a Secretary-General, who is elected by the Assemblies. Member states have a great degree of
freedom in their actions, while the SCG manages sapient rights, security, the economy, and diplomacy for humanity as a whole. It has a
diverse population, including many non-humans, and encompasses a wide range of systems, territories, habitats, and stellar bodies. The
Sol Central Government and its member states make up one of the more advanced and powerful civilizations in the known galaxy.

## The History of Sol Gov

When Humanity first started colonizing the Solar System, it was under the banner of the Old Earth, nation-states like China, America, and India planted their flags in the dirt of planets and moons throughout the system. Shortly behind them the private corporations followed, establishing corporate outposts and research stations away from the prying eyes of Earth. As the situation on Earth deteriorated, the colonies funded by corporations grew more powerful in the absence of oversight, and the colonies that eventually lost contact with their parent nation-states were left on their own. While some withered, being forced to fend for themselves, and others disappeared entirely, the strongest banded together and started to form some of the settlements and governments that we know so well today. As the flow of people from Earth grew, so did the settlements that had survived.

When Old Earth eked out a unified government under the banner of the Terran Commonwealth, it found a Solar System that had grown and developed independent of Earther control. When the Commonwealth re-exerted its power over its colonies, many places found themselves underrepresented by a body that did not have Colonial interests in mind. Eventually, war broke out. A few Martian colonies band together to form the Ares Confederation, and fight to gain their freedom. The first interstellar wars take a toll on development, but end in victory for the Commonwealth.

While full control over the Solar System may have been what the Commonwealth wanted, it wasn't what the Commonwealth needed, at least after Humanity slipped the bonds of its Solar System. Forced to confront its powerlessness to control an Inter-System collection of highly varied colonies, the Commonwealth devises a solution.

The Sol Central Government was created under the guiding principles of the Solar Declaration of Rights, which eventually became the Universal Declaration of Rights, based off of the Declaration of Human Rights of old United Nations. Recognizing the growth of Mars into a scientific and military powerhouse in Sol, the capital of SolGov is established on the red planet. All former members of the Commonwealth are allowed, finally, true determination as to whether or not they join the new system, and most do. As the role of the Corporations in founding the SCGB could not be understated, they were given status on the same level as the other states. SolGov handles such broad questions as direction of Humanity, and as mundane problem as trade regulations, and diplomacy.

The perks of membership included free trade and movement between the whole of SolGov territory, humanitarian aid to developing stations and colonies, as well as any that suffered a disaster, and eventually military protection from the criminal element that eventually followed Humanity into space. Members could enforce laws within their own borders, provided they followed the Declaration of Rights, and periodically allow observers to examine their societies for compliance.

As colonization continued in bordering systems, and time passed, and humanity continued to stretch out into the stars. SolGov shepherded the peoples of Earth, continuing and creating treaties with the Skrell, making first contact with the Unathi, and defending humanity from the Vox. Gateways and Bluespace drives allow Humans to spread further and faster than ever before. As humanity develops, so does SolGov, while recently corporations have outpaced the spread of SolGov's influence, SolGov is still highly influential in the more developed systems, and sometimes extends its light as far as the frontier, much to the annoyance of the TSCs.

## How Does it Work?

**The two primary voting bodies of SolGov are the Solar Assembly, and the Colonial Assembly.**

The Solar Assembly is what's left of the founding body. Any sovereign state in the Solar System with a human population of over 50,000 is eligible for membership, though two members with smaller populations remain from the original SCGB. In addition, any extrasolar states with a human population of over one billion on one body, planetary, lunar, or otherwise, is eligible for membership, though an extrasolar member hasn't been accepted in decades. While currently, Corporations based in Sol are only eligible for membership in the Colonial Assembly, a few minor corporations from the time of the SCGB remain, including Aether Atmospherics. While none of the nation-states of Earth are on the Solar Assembly, and likely won't be any time soon due to stigma and the inability to control their own borders, several do sit on the Assembly as observers. The Solar Assembly manages affairs within Sol and its largest neighbors, Tau Ceti and Centuari included. While any member of the Solar or Colonial Assemblies can propose a a peacekeeping operation, or major aid mission, only the Solar Assembly can approve it. Due to the size of both assemblies, votes are majority based.

### The Colonial Assembly

is open to any extrasolar state with a human population of over 500,000 in one system. That includes any states on a planet or moon, a union of smaller states under one banner, or even an entire allied system. Any corporation headquartered in Sol may also gain membership of the Colonial Assembly. In 2547, a radical group of Skrell separatists applied for membership in the Colonial Assembly, they were denied in order to maintain a positive relationship with the Skrell, but it sparked a debate over theoretically allowing Xeno-Sapients into SolGov in the future that has not been resolved to date. Six seats on the Colonial Assembly belong to elected representatives from the Solar Assembly, which typically change every year. While the ability to approve major military action rests with the Solar Assembly, the Colonial Assembly may veto such an action with a majority vote of more than 2/3 of the members, though this hasn't occurred yet. Organizations containing human members, but not eligible or desiring to sit on the Colonial Assembly may request observer status. The Free Trade Union is one of the most respected of the observers, due to its influence in a large swathe of human population, and it has been suggested on multiple occasions, without result, that they be given voting status, despite their lack of borders or centralized organization.

 **The spokesperson and face of SolGov is the Secretary-General,**

who is elected by the Colonial Assembly every three years, or after a vote of no confidence by either assembly. The Secretary-General is the only individual sapient, that with no backing state or corporation, is permitted to propose resolutions or action, however they are not a voting member of either assembly.

 **The highest legal authority in SolGov is the High Court.**

It interprets the laws of the SolGov Charter, and has the ultimate jurisdiction over lower SolGov court cases. It consists of 20 individually appointed Justices, 10 appointed by the Solar Assembly, and 10 appointed by the Colonial Assembly. A 21st member, the Supreme Justice is nominated by the Secretary-General, and must be approved by both Assemblies. Cases that go before the High Court range from evaluating the constitutionality of laws, appeals of lower court cases, intellectual property cases, major violations of the SolGov charter by states, leaders, groups, or individuals, and arbitrating conflicts between SolGov members.

**SolGov's vast territory is split into several organizational Sectors, each with their own administrative centers and hierarchy.**

This includes Solgov Sector or Low Courts. These courts handle civil and criminal cases under SolGov's jurisdiction within their sector. This includes crimes between multiple states within a sector, or in SolGov controlled space, local commercial disputes, and appeals from local judicary bodies. While smaller colonies, habitats, and other population clusters may have their own government, legal system, and police force, if these groups live inside SolGov territory, SolGov has the ultimate jurisdiction over legal matters that aren't within a member state. Judges are elected by SolGov citizens living within a sector unaffiliated with any member state, and server terms of ten years. As there are no term limits, it's not unheard of for judges to sit until their deaths or retirement.

Member States of SolGov are permitted to exercise their own legal authority over their citizens based on their own laws, as long as those laws are within the guidelines of the SolGov charter. However, SolGov does get involved in several matters of local law. Criminals that flee State they broke the law in, and do not commit crimes in any other areas inside SolGov before their recapture, are extradited back to the State they are charged in. If a criminal is guilty of crimes in multiple States, or in SolGov territory, they will be tried in the SolGov court system, which can be appealed all the way up to the High Court. Individuals wishing to extend their trials may also appeal to SolGov courts to hear a case on whether or not the laws of the State in question violate the SolGov charter. SolGov also has the right to adjudicate cases of its own choosing, should either assembly vote that a case should be sent to the High Court. This ability is only infrequently used though, due to the heavy pushback of member states in most instances.

### Committees: 

There are a variety of committees tasked with organizing the primary missions and tasks of SolGov forces, with each committee being staffed with members from both assemblies, elected to the positions from their respective assemblies. Typically the members of a committee have some special knowledge or bearing on an institution, such as an agriworld's representative sitting on the aid committee, or a security contracting corporation sitting on the peacekeeping committee. Members are typically rotated every solar year or so, however there is no limit to sequential terms.

### Corporations in SolGov:

While some corporations choose to stay clear of SolGov, and base their headquarters further towards the edge of human expansion, there are some benefits to being a corporate member, though those come with some downsides. Unlike states, corporations with membership in SolGov, with the exception of those in the Solar Assembly, are required to obey SolGov law, and report any violations therof. In addition, SolGov Observers are permanently installed in corporate offices that are based within a SolGov controlled gateway torus. However, corporations that are members of SolGov get access to more secure trade routes, with fewer tariffs and trade penalties. Their cargos and facilities are insured when in SolGov space. The ability to base offices and facilities within SolGov protected gateways is invaluable in lawless systems on the frontier such as Nyx. While often overlooked, free education, and cheap food from SolGov never hurt when running a Trans-Stellar corporation.

### Citizenship:

While the issue of nationality and citizenship has only grown more complex with births being possible in the void between systems, in orbit around a planet, or even in the harsh realm of bluespace, SolGov has attempted to combat this by allowing any human born to claim SolGov citizenship, or to claim the citizenship of either or both parents, if they were citizens of a SolGov member. Even humans already possessing citizenship within a member state may claim SolGov citizenship should they wish. Unemployed humans with sole citizenship of SolGov are encouraged to find employment within one of the many organizations of SolGov, but should they be unable or unwilling to work, they will be given enough food to subsist on, and a place to sleep in one of the many shelters SolGov operates.

### Membership: 

Once eligible for either assembly, human states and organizations need only petition their respective assembly and their membership will be put to a majority vote. While on several occasions, a poor Sapient Rights record, or outstanding conflict will prevent membership, most applicants are accepted in a timely manner. Non-Corporate Members of SolGov, in addition to having a say in the common direction of mankind, have more tangible economic and social benefits: access to SolGov trade routes; the ability to base facilities within gateways; military protection from aggressors, human or otherwise; access to the SolGov quantum communications network; and the promise of aid in the event of a disaster. In exchange, member states pay taxes to SolGov, pledge support, both in times of war and peace, and are subject to the SolGov charter.

### What's the Universal Declaration of Rights?

All right here, laid out for you: (link will be provided)

### The Charter

**The Sol Central Government Charter is the foundational treaty of the Sol Central Government. It was signed at the Palace of Nations in Geneva, on Earth, by the Terran Commonwealth and the founding members of the SCG on 12 November 2436. It went into effect on the first day of 2437, and marked the start of a new chapter in Humanity's history. The Charter defines the workings of the Sol Central Government, codifies its laws, and organizes its members. Functioning both as a constitution and a binding treaty, the Charter is what grants the SCG its powers and responsibilities. All states that have ratified the Charter must abide by it, or risk sanctions, punishments, and even expulsion, though the latter has never occurred. The charter contains the legal code of the Sol Central Government, largely based off of the Universal Declaration of Rights. While those human states that have not ratified the Charter do not have to abide by its rules and regulations, the SCG has enforced the Universal Declaration of Rights in non-members, though only in two extreme instances.**

____

### What Does it DO?

The assemblies largely form a basis for diplomacy and trade across human space, managing economic agreements, mining and environmental concerns, and ensuring Sapient Rights are upheld. For example, during the Synthetic Intelligence Rights Crisis of 2558, both the Solar and Colonial Assemblies declared Posibrains to be sapient, and therefore protected by the Universal Declaration of Rights. While member states manage affairs that fall under SolGov's jurisdiction within their own borders, including trade agreement and diplomacy between individual member states; gateways and the spaces between states are SolGov's jurisdiction, and any SolGov personnel and outposts within a member state are considered immune from that state's laws. SolGov's main presence can be found on most colonies and stations in the form of aid missions and schools, in space protecting gateways and establishing navigational beacons in nebulae, and even on the frontier, as Colonial Marshals track down criminals that have fled from SolGov administered systems to what they think is safe anonymity. Most of SolGov's revenue comes from taxes on the use of its gateways, communication systems, and secure trade routes, typically higher for non-members, as well as regular funding by corporations and individual member states. While SolGov has no say over legal interactions between member states, it is permitted by its charter to negotiate with other political entities, human or otherwise. While the many organizations of SolGov are staffed by SolGov citizens, member states often send their own personnel to serve and gain experience.



### Economic Mission: 

The Committee for Economic Development is responsible for managing the monetary interaction of colonies and corporations. It ensures the free travel of goods, services, people, and fiscal capital. It is the regulatory body responsible for maintaining the Thaler, investigating fraud between member states, establishing safe trade routes, preventing the sale and transport of contraband across the gateway network, and ensuring the stability of the interstellar economy. As instant communication between systems is still expensive if it's required to be quicker and more detailed than a basic black and white fax, so the CED is responsible for maintaining communication channels, especially the stock market, which would be almost impossible to coordinate without the SolGov quantum communication arrays across human space. Organizations managed by the CED include the **Bureau of Natural Resources**, the **Gateway Administration**, the **Customs and Trade Bureau**, the **Bureau of Energy**, the **Solar Bank**, the **Bureau of Finance**, the **Astronomical Society**, the **Census Bureau**, the **Patent and Trademark Office**, the **Communications Bureau**, the **Interstellar Postal Service**, and the **Bureau of Research**.

* **Gateway Administration**:

One of the most understated, but vital parts of SolGov, the Gateway Administration manages the construction and operation of all Gateways in SolGov territory. While several contracting companies do most of the hard labor, the GA ensures all gateways are built to the exacting standards required, and then keeps them running properly and safely.

* Customs and Trade Bureau: 

Agents of the Customs and Trade Bureau run customs checks at most gateways, and are typically involved in raids on smuggling operations and the like. However they also do the more mundane tasks of shipping, like inspecting and labeling interstellar freight.

* Solar Bank: 

The Solar Bank provides several essential banking services to SolGov and its member states. Not only does it provide insured banking to SolGov citizens, and humans without any citizenship, it provides loans to struggling states and organizations for humanitarian purposes. Most importantly, it works with the Bureau of Finance to regulate the Thaler and its value.

The Thaler (þ, code THL) is the official currency recognized by the Sol Gov. It is the most common currency used in Sol Central-space and its territories, and it is the most popular currency for international or interplanetary transactions. The Thaler is the most dominant currency used by the Free Trade Union, although the organization does not restrict the use of alternate currencies in its jurisdiction.

The value of the Thaler is defined by a Sol Central document published by the organization's economics committee and approved by a joint vote in both the Solar and Colonial assemblies.



* Interstellar Postal Service: 

While they may seem at times antiquated, the public courier services provided by the IPS are essential. Even with private options available, many still send packages and sensitive communication via the ships of the IPS.

### Sapientarian Mission: 

Once limited to humans, the Committee for Sapientarian Development now sets its sights on ensuring basic rights for all sapient life. It constructs schools at all levels, from Medical Academies to Kindergartens, for communities without formalized education systems or poor access to higher learning. Hospitals and aid stations are not only present within gateway toruses, but in areas on the frontiers of member systems, or in locations that require advanced medical care. Several member states have given up thousands of square kilometers on their planets to the Sapientarian Committee for growing the food required for massive aid missions. Wherever sentients are in need within SolGov's influence, you can bet some of their people will be there trying to improve conditions. Some of the most notable parts of the CSD are the **Bureau of Observers**, the **Refugee Office**, the **Bureau of Agriculture**, the **Aid Agency**, the **Bureau of Education**, the **Interstellar Health Service**, the **Bureau of Migration**, the **Housing Agency**, and the **Bureau of Citizenship**.

* **Bureau of Observers**:

As the name suggests, the Bureau of Observers places and is in charge of the observers in member states, ensuring the Universal Declaration of Rights is upheld, and members are acting within their boundaries and responsibilities. Observers are also sent to non-SolGov worlds during Rights Crises and other turmoil.

* Interstellar Health Service:

The IHS is responsible for providing free and comprehensive medical care to all Sapients in SolGov space. Typically based in Gateway Toruses, SolGov installations, and in the capitals of member states. Services include complete surgical suites, prosthetic care, sleeve rejection therapy, reproductive health services, and non-human anatomy experts.

* Bureau of Citizenship: 

Currently engaged in heavy debate about allowing non-human sapients citizenship, the Bureau of Citizenship manages passports and citizenship in the complicated web of loyalties and allegiances present in SolGov. All humans wishing for general SolGov citizenship instead of their birth state or corporate sponsor may simply apply to the BoC and become a citizen of SolGov, with all the rights and assets that entails.

### Diplomatic Mission: 

The Committee for Diplomatic Relations has seen a lot of change in the last few years. Originally tasked managing relations between the different member states, and interfacing with the Skrell, the CDR has recently seen the establishment of the Interstellar Assembly. This small, two-part body, was created in conjunction with the Skrell in order to create a more formal diplomatic setting for communication between the different species living alongside one another in the galaxy. The Assembly is composed of The Council, and the Senate. The Council seats one semi-permanent representative from each species in the Assembly, currently Humans, Skrell, Tajara, and Unathi. The Senate seats representatives based on population, with a minimum of two seats per race, it currently seats four SolGov representatives, three Skrell, two Tajara, and two Unathi. This body is currently responsible for treaties and laws agreed on between these races, with the begrudging acceptance of those involved. Additionally, the CDR manages the travel of non-citizens and other sapients through SolGov space. Most prominent in the massive embassy complex on Mars, smaller SolGov embassy complexes are also operated and maintained by the CDR. Organizations under the control of the CDR include the **Bureau of Tourism**, the **Intellectual Exchange Program**, the **Embassy Office**, the **Ambassadorial Service**, and most recently, the **Expeditionary Corps**.

* Intellectual Exchange Program: 

A more recent addition to the Committee, the Intellectual Exchange Program oversees the transfer of technology to and from SolGov and its allies. While corporations have typically been responsible for sharing information with new species, at a price, SolGov has agreed to share some technologies with the Unathi and Tajara for humanitarian reasons.

* Ambassadorial Service: 

Tasked with providing SolGov ambassadors to all member states and other entities wishing diplomatic contact, the Ambassadorial Service is a common first step for the children of the wealthy and successful seeking political office.

* **Expeditionary Corps**: 

Originally under the Committee for Economic Development, the Expeditionary Corps was founded in the early days of SolGov in order to regulate human exploration of space. Its duties included First Contact with newly discovered races, survey and cataloging of newly discovered systems and interstellar bodies, and marking sites for the construction of Gateways. However, as corporations began to consistently outpace official exploration efforts, the Expeditionary Corps began to decline. By 2550, the Corps only had three functioning ships and barely over two hundred personnel. Following the discovery of the Phoron Giant Erebus, and the renewed interest in exploration, the Expeditionary Corps has had a new lease on life. Largely rebuilt from the ground up to support the Torch Project, the Corps was moved under the Committee for Diplomatic Relations and the Interstellar Assembly. This was partially due to the many interests competing to have influence over the project, and partially due to the Torch Project's primary mission of making contact with undiscovered sapient life. With the construction of the SEV Torch completed, the Expeditionary Corps is preparing to launch the greatest mission of exploration since humanity first left Sol.

### Peacekeeping Mission: 

Unlike the United Nations on Old Earth, SolGov maintains its own standing police and military forces, both under the aegis of the Committee of Defense and Security. Somewhat controversially, the CDS is also responsible for managing intelligence, counterterrorism, and border security in SolGov territory. While accusations of abuse by internal security are nothing new, the current hidden cold war with the Khaarmani has internal tensions at an all time high as almost all communications traffic is being monitored. Gateways and space lanes have become increasingly militarized, and it's not uncommon for pilots to be detained indefinitely if their flight paths come too close to any sensitive assets. Though the most visible portions of the CDS are the **Defense Forces** and the **Colonial Marshal Bureau**, it also manages the **Office of Interstellar Intelligence**, the **Bureau of Counterterrorism**, the **Assembly Security Agency**, the **Emergency Management Bureau**, the **Rescue Service**, the **Bureau of Border Security**, the **Defense Intelligence Agency**, the **Bounty Office**, the **Bureau of Corrections**, and the **Home Guard**.

* **Defense Forces**:

The SolGov Defense Forces consist of an Army, for operations on planets, moons, or larger planetoids, and a Fleet, including a Marine component, responsible for operations in space, aboard habitats or vessels, and the gateway network. The Fleet is by far the larger component, composed of dozens of larger vessels like carriers and cruisers, a few massive battlecruisers and supercarriers, and hundreds of smaller vessels and strike craft. There are five standing Fleets under Fleet Command, they are spread throughout security details and patrols. The Army is smaller, and only maintains minimal troop numbers at any given time. Units used to be composed of integrated forces, made up of military personnel from across the member states, as well as SolGov citizens serving permanently or temporarily in the Defense Forces, with member states rotating their forces in and out of use as needed. However, with the increase in the number of SolGov citizens, and general paranoia relating to the Khaarmani, the Assemblies voted to restrict service in the Defense Forces to SolGov citizens, preventing conflicts of interest among different colonial groups. In the event of a major peacekeeping operation all members are still required to offer military aid, but with their own individual units instead of general numbers. SGDF are rarely seen in large numbers outside of Sol and its immediate neighbors. Typically any outpost in a hostile area, or on the border of human space and its Xeno-Sapient neighbors, will have a small contingent for protection. Every gateway in SolGov territory has a crew running traffic control operations, and a ship or two protecting the gate itself. The closer you get to the inner systems, the more presence you'll see of the SGDF. Mostly smaller ships doing customs work and patrolling trade corridors. Only on two occasions has the SGDF been mobilized for a major peacekeeping operation, both in response to major sapient rights violations on non member worlds. Occasionally a member world will request aid in dealing with unrest, a riot, or piracy problems, and smaller missions will be tasked to deal with them.

* **Colonial Marshal Bureau**: 

While the SolGov Defense Forces operate on the level of planets and systems, the SolGov Colonial Marshals operate on the individual level. To combat the web of jurisdictions that is human space, the Defense Committee established the Marshal Bureau. Marshals largely operate out of gateway network, though some more heavily populated systems and settlements may have Marshal offices. Colonial Marshals act across the borders of the various members of SolGov, and even beyond, into neutral territory. When inside SolGov space, Marshals pursue individuals of any species that have violated SolGov law. For example, if an individual attempts to destroy a habitat in one system, but flees to another system before local law enforcement can apprehend them, Colonial Marshals are legally permitted to cross member borders freely in order to capture the runner. Criminals apprehended by the Marshals are typically extradited to the member state where they committed the crime, though people committing crimes in SolGov facilities, outside of SolGov controlled space, and the criminals turned over to SolGov by corporations are held and rehabilitated in SolGov's penal facilities. These penal facilites are operated by the Bureau of Corrections, and are typically considered some of the nicer prisons available. Wanted criminals have been known to commit a crime that will get them extradited to SolGov, rather than face incarceration in their home systems. Outside of SolGov controlled territory, Colonial Marshals also operate with the Bounty Office. The office posts bounties, allowing locals collect criminals that have slipped outside of their jurisdiction in exchange for payment. The office also certifies Bounty Hunters and on occasion grants Letters of Marque to Private Military Corporations or independent captains. However, in some instances, Marshals may travel through unaffiliated territory in order to reach a settlement belonging to a member state, or to capture particularly heinous criminals in an area local law enforcement or bounty hunters may be unreliable. Several diplomatic incidents have occurred as a result of actions by the Marshal Bureau outside of SolGov jurisdiction.

* Office of Interstellar Intelligence: 

Originally the only intelligence gathering force in SolGov, the OII is the external intelligence service of Sol Central Government. Though it primarily uses conventional intelligence gathering techniques, the OII also monitors communications outside of SolGov's borders. Providing intelligence for all parts of the government, the OII is one of the better funded sections of SolGov. Though it doesn't have any law enforcement capabilities or duties, the OII is capable of direct action through its Special Activities Office, though only when authorized to do so by the Secretary-General.

* Assembly Security Agency: 

Specifically tasked with protecting the assemblies and their delegates, the ASA is a small, but well trained group. Though not often seen by the public, delegates travelling two and from their homes are often transported aboard ships belonging to Assembly Security.

* Emergency Management Bureau: 

Originally under the Committee for Sapientarian Development, the Emergency Management Bureau handles the internal disasters of SolGov. While the Aid Agency handles the crises of member states, the EMB works with the Rescue Service to handle spacecraft accidents, habitat damage, and other day to day emergencies in SolGov territory.

* Defense Intelligence Agency:

While in the past, the Colonial Marshals have handled intelligence gathering within SolGov, a few major scandals and failures of intelligence tarnished their reputation, most notably when an unknown drone successfully masqueraded as a media synthetic and recorded an entire meeting of the Interstellar Assembly. As a result, the Defense Committee recently formed the Defense Intelligence Agency, tasked with domestic security and intelligence gathering. Now fielding offices in most SolGov member states, the DIA has rapidly grown in power and influence. Sweeping legislation has allowed the DIA significant legal authorities in matters of "Internal Security," including the ability to monitor communications and travel. While protests are now commonplace, it's unlikely SolGov will curtail the powers of the DIA any time soon.

* Home Guard:

The Home Guard is an elite force made up of both SGDF and Marshal elements that provides physical security and law enforcement in Sol itself, including a special detatchment that protects the Secretary-General.

## Who's Who, What's What, and Where is it? - People, Places, and Things

* Olympus, Mars:

Built into, around, and on the plains surrounding the extinct supervolcano Olympus Mons, the city of Olympus was originally a research station, terraforming center, and spaceport. Due to its location, and relative lack of development, it was selected as the Capital for the Sol Central Government in the waning days of the Terran Commonwealth and built up into a massive diplomatic and governmental center. Both Assemblies are built into the volcano itself, along with the offices of many other organizations, the High Court, the Embassy Complex, and facilities for keeping the city running. Massive transit tunnels crisscross the mountain's interior, and its surroundings. Olympus has grown significantly out around the mountain, and onto the plains around it, though the highest density of government facilities remains in the volcano itself. The inside wall of the caldera is lined with landing pads and government apartments, and the very bottom of the caldera is home to a massive park, showcasing a unique ecosystem imported from Earth.

* Gateway One, Lunar Orbit: 

While the first gateway used by humanity orbited the Earth, that first gate, connecting Sol to its closest neighbor Alpha Centauri, has since been decommissioned and is now a museum. A larger, more advanced gate was constructed in a stable orbit around Luna. One of the most heavily guarded places in human space, Gateway One is the only way to enter or exit Sol without a Bluespace Drive.

* Hermes Naval Shipyard and Orbital Drydock, Venusian Orbit:

One of the largest shipyards made by humanity, the Hermes Shipyard not only provides a stable platform for constructing vessels of peace and war, but also houses the crews and corporate offices of many corporations contracted to build ships for SolGov.

* The Sol Central Government Fleet Academy, Buenos Aires, Earth:

The SCG Fleet Academy, is a four year service academy established for the purpose of educating and training young leaders for service in the Fleet as Officers. Candidates for admission must apply directly, and receive a nomination from an Assembly representative. Graduates commission as Ensigns in the Fleet, or Second Lieutenants in the Marine Corps.

* SFV Amazon: 

Flagship of the Fleet, the Amazon is an advanced Battlecarrier, designed for command and control, and carries a large complement of marines and strike craft. It remains garrisoned in Sol with the rest of First Fleet.

* SFV Terra: 

An older ship that originally belonged to the Terran Commonwealth, converted into a museum ship, kept officially on active duty for ceremonial purposes.

* SEV Torch:

Currently sitting in drydock at the Shiva Fleet Yards undergoing final preparations for its exploratory mission, the Torch is the culmination of almost a decade of negotiations and cooperation between many organizations, both inside the government and out.

* SEV Magnus:

One of the major ships in the Expeditionary Corps, it went missing during its exploration into the far outer reaches of the Trajan System.

* Amaya Barros:

A career politician, the current Secretary-General of SolGov was born on Luna, and served in a variety of positions in SolGov before being selected to be Githari Exports' delegate on the Colonial Assembly. From there, she moved up through the Assembly, sitting as chair of the Committee for Diplomatic relations, and overseeing the creation of the Interstellar Assembly. After being selected as the next Secretary-General, Ms. Barros has shed her reputation as being soft-spoken, instead being one of the most vocal individuals on the Assembly floor.

* First Fleet: 

A mainly ceremonial force after the creation of the Home Guard, the First Fleet is permanently garrisoned in Sol, and is where all new fleet vessels are assigned until they are sent to another unit. The First Fleet does occasionally send individual vessels or groups of vessels for Public Relations missions, ceremonies, or to escort dignitaries between Sol and other systems.

* Second Fleet: 

The largest of the SGDF's fleets, Second fleet is responsible for the direct security of the SCG's interior territories, especially the systems closest to Sol. In order to cover so much space, the Second Fleet includes four carrier strike groups, and a large marine complement.

* Third Fleet: 

Assigned to border security along with Fourth Fleet, Third Fleet is considered one of the most experienced Fleets, as it regularly deals with pirate raids and Vox incursions. Battle-hardened, most Third Fleet ships and crews are not without their scars.

* Fourth Fleet:

Specifically assigned to secure the border of Skrell space that separates the Khaarman Ascent from humanity, the Fourth Fleet is sometimes considered the place where slackers are sent to languish, as officially they are only protecting the Skrell border. While this reputation may have been true to an extent, recent tensions have caused an overhaul of Fourth Fleet. With many incompetent or ineffective officers having been shown the door, Fourth Fleet may have to prove its mettle before long.

* Fifth Fleet:

A recent creation, still being organized and modified, the Fifth Fleet was created in 2559 by the Assemblies in order to act as a Quick Reaction Force. While it is still small, the Fifth Fleet is being staffed with some of the brightest minds of the Defense Forces, and equipped with the latest technology.

## What's the International Assembly?

(information for IA to be put later)
