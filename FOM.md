# The Fury of Mankind

## History

The human supremacist terrorist group Fury of Mankind was founded in 2536 by Vipin Karna, a political activist native to what is now the Republic of New Oreland’s biggest city and capital, Forneyville (Mars).

Vipin Karna was formerly a member of the far-right, pro-human Vorcian Front political party that got in countless political manifestations to protest several local pro-alien immigration reforms that were instituted in 2523, to no avail. Seeing the lack of success he had gained with his actions, he decided to take a step further: organize with the most die hard pro-human extremists in his home city to create the Fury of Mankind terrorist group.

Thanks to the personal wealth of Vipin Karna, the group was quickly able to gain many supporters, general militants and funding. In the 8th of july of 2537 the first public FOM terrorist act was performed. An explosive device was planted in a Tajaran ghetto in the city of Forneyville, which killed 28 people, injured 137 and destroyed several buildings.

Initially it was hard to track down the perpetrators of these acts as they would often retreat to underground sections of the city, where law enforcement tends to have a lesser influence. The general success of these actions eventually allowed the group to expand their actions to other parts of not just the Vorcian Federation, but Mars in general: it reached Olympus Mons in 2540, Vorcia City in 2541 and Catti City in 2546.

They were fast to diversify their actions as well. At first, they were solely targeting xeno ghettos but later on many other targets were added upon to that: human populations, governmental institutions, even corporations.

In the past, FOM had been intensifying their activities on Forneyville, as it had one of the largest alien populations in the Vorcian Federation by then (approximately 400000, and steadily increasing). Due to diverse reasons, in 2546 the city declared independence from the Vorcian Federation to create the Republic of New Oreland, a new regime that would crack down hard on this terrorist group. Although many were arrested and others forced to flee the city, terrorist acts still occured occasionally here, especially during the New Oreland-Vorcia war.

In 2559, FOM is still active and under the leadership of Vipin Karna, who is assumed to be organizing the group’s activities in underground sections of the Vorcia City mega-metropolis. At this point, they have been labelled as a terrorist organization by virtually every single government on Mars.

Currently they have about 10000 active militants spread in all of the known galaxy, most being located in underground sections of Olympus Mons and the Vorcia City mega-metropolis, such as East Conriston. In addition, they have countless of supporters and aspiring members.

The group also has a noticeable presence in extrasolar locations such as Nova Atlantis (Tiamat), and the Hauler’s Tragedy asteroid belt (Nyx).

## Operations

FOM is a terrorist group in it’s purest form: an hostile group that uses terror and fear to achieve their political goals.

By far, their most popular and widespread technique is to kidnap xenos from ghettos or general populations, to then torture them and stream these actions on popular sites of the public Net. Often, they have an intent to free them, but ransoms or the liberation of certain FOM prisoners are demanded during this process, which is one the main forms of funding they have. Sometimes no intent to free them exists or no money is demanded at all, and the torture is simply performed to induce nothing but fear.

Phoron supplies are always demanded by this group as it allows them to create powerful bombs that don’t require a lot of effort. Typically, the group will make it’s presence known before or during a bombing, which is often done in xeno ghettos, governmental institutions or corporate facilities.

Hit and run murders are common too, especially against politicians and xenos. With access to stealth technology, it’s entirely possible to make the presence of FOM known, kill your targets and retreat to the underground where it’s hard to be caught.

While FOM keeps very mixed views when it comes to synthetics, they still use them for their terrorist acts. The group is known for acquiring cheap robots and programming them to perform their task, which might range from stealing important supplies to murdering people, or to deliver bombs to a certain planned location.

Activities are typically organized by individual members on a local scale, but long-range communication efforts still exist.

These activities have occurred for many years and are moderately effective in spreading chaos and achieving their political goals. Many governmental institutions refuse to enact further pro-alien laws and might even repeal any that were already instituted, in order to desperately prevent additional terrorist attacks.

Areas with a high degree of FOM activity are usually made very undesirable for xeno populations, who will often not hesitate to leave their residence for a safer place. Additional xeno immigration is reduced with this process as well.

FOM gains it’s supporters with two methods:

First, via the few people that can reach the “nomadic” deep Net sites the group maintains. While upcoming activities are often not discussed here (if they want to induce fear, a public network will be used for that), the sites are often used as a database for propaganda, xeno dox, conspiracy theories and what not. Arranging meetups with FOM members is entirely possible here, but still rare due to the tight control the group maintains.

Secondly, most supporters but especially the militant ones are recruited from poor settlements, jails and prisons. The group will do extensive research on people (mostly teenagers), and if they see potential in them, they’ll give them a chance to gain more wealth and respect by introducing them into the human supremacist ideology and eventually, introducing them into terrorist acts if they’re deemed to be loyal and effective enough.

Active militants usually don’t hesitate to engage in terrorist acts, as the death penalty is practically non-existent at the moment. The group has many reliable methods to free certain imprisoned members they use regularly. FOM prison gangs are widespread in some parts of human space, having become one of the most powerful ones. In fact, several supporters or militants might deliberately attempt to get themselves jailed for a short amount of time, especially during violent events such as riots. Once in jail, they might be able to get in contact with non-members to spread the ideology further, perhaps even being able to gain new supporters.

While the group is vilified in rich neighborhoods and xeno ghettos, they’re typically respected in poorer or middle class settlements where the human supremacist ideology is widespread. If law enforcement is particularly low in a certain area, they might be able to gain additional funding by creating protection rackets.

Surprisingly enough, not everyone in the group is human. An extremely small number of xenos and free-willed synthetics are FOM members right now. It’s typically near impossible for a non-human to get in contact with representatives of this group, but when it does happen, they might consider adding a few non-human members to the group if they have something to make up for it (contacts in xeno communities, money etc.)

## Motives/Beliefs

FOM believes in the far-right human supremacist ideology: that humans are superiors to “xenos”, and that their race has a right to expand all over the galaxy. Officially, they want to achieve this all over human space:

* To prevent the enactment of pro-xeno laws that are destructive to human society.
* To repeal any existent pro-xeno laws that are destructive to human society.
* To prevent the arrival of new xenos in traditional human space.
* To eliminate any xenos currently living in traditional human space.
* To ensure the survival of our ideology.
* These objectives might change in the future, if they were expand their activities to traditional xeno space.

Some additional very mixed views and objectives are maintained by a few members, like when it comes to synthetics. Right now, the ideology doesn’t officially denounce synthetics since they don’t believe that they’re a notable threat to most of humanity at the moment. Most can agree that significant problems could arise if pro-synthetic legislation keeps being passed, and that most should be kept under strict control. A small number of terrorist acts were performed to slow down that legislative process, but it’s typically not a priority of FOM at the moment.
