## Demographics

### Species makeup

[Human][4]: 99.1%  
[Tajaran][5]: 0.5%  
[Unathi][6]: 0.3%  
[Skrell][7]: 0.1%

[Skrell][7] and [Diona][8] are virtually unseen on the majority of Luna (especially near the farside where Selendites have repeatedly blocked attempts by xeno governments to gain a political foothold on Luna), though there is a disproportionately high [Skrell][7] population in Elysium. [Tajarans][5] and [Unathi][6] are only there because some Selendites consider it to be fashionable to have a [Tajaran][5] maid or a [Unathi][6] bodyguard.

### Religious makeup

Irreligious group: 38%  
Unitarian: 31%  
Shinto: 12%  
Deist: 8%  
Confucian: 6%  
Other: 5%

## History

In 2167, the height of the Third Cold War, the first major colonization effort was made to create an inhabitable city on the Moon. American, Indian, and European moguls rushed to found the city of Selene on the farside of the moon, while Japanese and Chinese moguls founded Yuèliàng on the nearside. They both fared well with support from their Earth-bound sponsors, however in 2233 the Great Recession hit Earth, forcing both cities to become independent of Earth's economy. This is when the American corporation Expansive Visions Transportation pushed Selene far ahead of Yuèliàng by introducing a more efficient atmospherics system that allowed Selene to become independent a decade before Yuèliàng. Arthur Greyson, the CEO of Expansive Visions Transportation, used this advantage to buy up holdings on Luna and secure control of most of Selene while he re-branded his company into [Aether Atmospherics and Recycling][9].

Other corporations, now being pushed out of Selene, used this new technology to create their own cities and holdings on Luna. With funding from the growing [Hesphaistos Industries][10], New Hamburg was founded in 2241 and became the third major city on Luna. Other smaller cities cropped up, such as New Amsterdam, which would eventually be purchased and grown by [NanoTrasen][11], and other smaller cities that would eventually be purchased by [trans-stellar corporations][12].

Seeing the growing influence of Trans-Stellars on Luna, the [Free Trade Union][13] partnered with [SolGov][14] to began a campaign to unify Luna into a centralized democratic government in order to limit the control of Trans-Stellar corporations. Several concessions had to be made in order to get the Trans-Stellars to sign on to the new Constitution however, including giving the newly formed Prefectures immense power within their own domains, as well as making Luna a directorial republic with no single head of State. However, these concessions were eventually made and the Lunar Confederation was formed in 2275.

In order to maintain control on a federal level, the [trans-stellar corporations][12] created proxy political parties to campaign for seats in the Lunar Assembly as well as for Director. Due to their immense funding, these parties became the most powerful parties on Luna, their only rivals being each other, the Free Trade Party, and the Unification Party. To this day, the only political parties on Luna who've won more than three single seats in the Lunar Assembly are funded by a [trans-stellar][12], the [Free Trade Union][13], or [Sol Central][14].

## Politics

Luna is a nation that was founded as a collective effort of a very large group of very rich people who all sought to claim their own piece of the moon, and the modern Lunar political system reflects this history.

Firstly, it is a federal system with a large number of prefectures based on land owned. A single prefecture is determined by what land is owned by whom – the largest prefectures are those owned by the seven major trans stellar companies, but dozens of other smaller prefectures exist owned by smaller companies or hereditary rulers who have been willed land, though these types of prefectures have been disappearing due to land being purchased by larger companies. Prefects have a large amount of authority within their domains, though they are not entirely absolute. The federal level does have the power to apply laws across the board which apply to all prefectures, and and the Lunar Armed Forces are controlled on a federal level. Besides this, however, prefects have a significant amount of autonomous power, and some even have police forces equivalent to a standing military.

The federal government is intensely complicated for a variety of reasons. First of all, this means that it is harder for outside companies and governments to break into the system and exert their influence over the proud Lunar people. Secondly, the government is designed to allow for exploitation by the corporations who designed it, so each group who had a hand in creating the system created their own nooks and crannies to exploit. This is another reason that the prefectures are so powerful, simply because the federal government is convoluted and inefficient.

First, the federal government is bicameral. The House of Prefects is the upper house of legislation, and represents the prefectures roughly equally, however larger prefects (determined primarily by land mass rather than population, though population does play a role in the decision making) do have more seats in the House of Prefects. The prefectures owned by the Transtellars, for example, each have three seats in the House, while the majority of prefectures have two seats, and the smallest prefectures have one seat each. Due to the fluid nature of the prefectures as land is exchanged on a regular basis, the seat value of each Prefectures is determined every two years by the Board of Directors. Prefects are not elected, and are instead appointed by the owners of the land. There are usually about 100 seats in the House of Prefects, but this number fluctuates from year to year.

The lower house is the Lunar Assembly, which was created in an effort to give the inhabitants a voice in legislation, and is as such the most democratic institution on Luna. Representatives are democratically elected using proportional representation based on a large number of political parties. Individual representatives are chosen by the party leaders, and each party is given a number of seats based on the percentage of the vote they received throughout Luna. There are always 400 seats in the Lunar Assembly, elections are held every four years, and the President of the Lunar Assembly (elected by the representatives of the Assembly by way of coalition governments) is the Head of Government. There are nine major parties with significant shares of the seats, though there are also a number of smaller parties. These nine parties are each technically independent, but are heavily influenced by their sponsors, who are the seven Trans-Stellar corporations as well as the Free Trade Union and Sol Central.

Legislation may begin in either house, but must be approved in both houses in order to pass. Both houses have an opportunity to make amendments to a bill regardless of which house it begins in, and the process of amendments and counter-amendments continues until both houses can pass the bill with a fifty percent majority, with the exception of constitutional changes which require a seventy percent majority in both houses. Legislation of any kind can then be sent to the Board of Directors for approval.

The Board of Directors is the collective Head of State for Luna. They are voted for as individuals, and campaign for different positions on the board. Elections for the Board of Directors are every four years, staggered with the elections for the Lunar Assembly so that every two years there is an election either for the Board of Directors or for the Assembly. Directors tend to be associated with political parties in the Assembly, but can also be autonomous. There are seven chairs on the board, meaning that at least two of the major nine parties are always left out in any given election.

## Geography

Luna is not terraformed due to it being too small to hold an atmosphere, so the cities are actually just massive biodomes connected by underground subways and spaceports. As well, Luna's gravity is very small, and Lunarians have adapted (and been genetically engineered) to live within the low gravity, though many large cities do have weak gravity generators. There are currently fifty-four Prefectures on Luna, which become increasingly urban as you approach the farside of Luna that was first colonized and has become the seat of power on Luna, and increasingly sparse as you get away from Selene. The largest and most powerful prefecture is centred around Selene and is owned by [Aether Atmospherics and Recycling][9]. Towards the nearside of Luna are smaller prefectures owned by independent companies, entrepreneurs, and researchers who wished to study on Luna without getting involved in the convoluted politics of the Selendites. As you get closer to the nearside, you also begin to see greater support for the Free Trade Union and Solgov, while towards the farside [trans-stellar corporations][12] have immense support.

### Notable settlements

Selene, the first city and capitol of both Luna and the [Aether][9] Prefecture. Selene is the center of Lunar politics and commerce, and is also a strong contender to be the centre of arts and culture, though many would dispute that title in favour of New Vegas. It has weak gravity generators which were state of the art at the time of Selene's founding hundreds of years ago, but were not yet capable of creating Earth-like gravity. In modern times this actually has the advantage of making Selene habitable to both visitors from the rest of Luna who are unused to heavy gravity, and visitors from the rest of Sol who are unused to the light gravity of the rest of the moon. Selene's architecture is inspired by Greek and Roman architecture but built on a grander scale – massive marble skyscrapers support the biodome above, built to resemble tremendous pillars of the Parthenon while the insides function as shopping centers, offices, and more. Statues of Greek and Roman deities stand in parks, squares, and shopping malls, interjecting the other trappings of a modern city with relics and recreations of the past.

* New Vegas, the capitol of the [Gilthari][15] Prefecture. Gilthari Exports sought to recreate the greatest den of sin on old Earth. They had attempted to do the same on Mars in large casinos, but in the mid-24th century the CEO at the time had the ambitious plan to create an entire city set up specifically to make Gilthari Exports a lot of money – and it's been working brilliantly. New Vegas is the number one tourist destination on Luna. It's situated right on the edge of what would be considered the farside, close enough to Selene to appeal to Selendites but far enough to not scare away the people who dislike Selendite politics. Due to its popularity as a tourist destination, it has state-of-the-art gravity generators and is one of the few places on Luna with Earth-like gravity for the comfort of visitors from Earth and Mars.

* New Hamburg, a city in the [Hestaiphos][10] Prefecture near Selene in which the Lunar Armed Forces are headquartered, as well as the Hestaiphos Lunar Branch, obviously. As such, the Lunar Armed Forces are equipped with the best weapons in Sol, a show that has played a key role in Luna's independence. It is not much younger than Selene and Yuèliàng, and its architecture is built in the style popular in the early 23rd century with modernity, sleekness, and practicality in mind. It has similar weak gravity generators as the kind used in Selene.

* Yuèliàng was founded soon after Selene except on the other side of the moon. It never gained the same amount of popularity as Selene due to Aether's marketing strategy, but remains one of the oldest and among the largest cities on the moon, and is popular among those who wish to enjoy the luxury of living on Luna without the politics of Selene or having to deal with the tourists who plague New Vegas. It is the only prefecture not associated with a trans-stellar corporation to have three seats in the House of Prefects. It was not built with gravity generators however, and attempts to build prefecture-wide generators have failed for financial infeasibility, and to maintain an independent culture from the Selendites, which is something that many Yuèliàngers pride themselves upon. It's architecture is based on

Elysium is an independent prefecture that had been funded by a collective effort by the Ivy League Universities of Earth to create an academic haven on the moon that would be the forefront of Sol research. Not far from Yuèliàng, it was strategically placed to be distinctly separate from Selendite politics but close enough to a major city to have the benefits which that entails. It has two seats in the House of Prefects. Unlike many cities on the nearside, it has weak gravity generators.

New Amsterdam wouldn't be a particularly noteworthy city in the grand scheme of Luna, however it is the Capitol of the [Nanotrasen][16] Prefecture, and since you work for Nanotrasen, you'd best know what that is. Compared to Selene, New Hamburg, and New Vegas, New Amsterdam is pretty small, but it's still a decently sized city worthy of being a capital.

## Culture

Due to the autonomous nature of prefectures, Luna has a very diverse culture that varies widely depending on where you are. As evidenced by the diversity of the architecture of the above cities alone, each city was founded with unique visions – and the money to fulfil them. As a result, each prefecture is highly unique, though they sometimes borrow cultural ideas from each other, they just as frequently deliberately make themselves stand out among the other prefectures by drawing upon different cultural influences, especially in the cases of Selene and Yuèliàng which have had a long-standing rivalry and attempt to differentiate themselves from each other.
